JAM was a home base ina

hostile world for generations of

Black artists. It was that rare

_ place in New York where you

uld meet other people in other

ciplines who were different—

eople of color, but also those

‘folks who wanted to be involved

_ with them. And I'll tell you,
that's hard. It’s hard to find that
community that crosses race and
crosses discipline. It was people
articulating the ways in which
they didn’t fit.

Tony Whitfield, JAM curator and artist
