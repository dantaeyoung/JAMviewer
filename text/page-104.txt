Conceived by Robert Atkins—an art historian, curator,
and critic from San Francisco—About TV addressed

commercial television's overwhelming influence on
American society. This multifaceted exhibition and
screening program brought together artists who
explored the possibilities of video while challenging its
mass deployment for delivering information and enter-
tainment, in the form of television as well as in newer
technologies such as video surveillance and video
games. Deeply influenced by the conceptualism of the
preceding decade, the participating artists incorporated
these “non-art systems” into their art.** Video-art instal-
lations were shown alongside televised media and the
