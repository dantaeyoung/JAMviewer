Undercurrents Gallery

The downstairs space at JAM’s Franklin Street location
hosted solo or two-person shows—often the featured
artists’ first exhibitions in the city. Many of these art-
ists were selected through the gallery's open submis-
sion process or through word of mouth. Among those
in the latter category was Albert Chong, who wandered
into JAM while on a stroll downtown. At the gallery, he
met Fred Wilson and David Hammons, who advised
him to submit work samples, which led to his exhibition
Undercurrents.?

In the photographs Chong was making at the time,
the body often acts as a conduit between the spiritual
world and conceptual art. Minimal Mystic (1982; plate
80), for example, pictures a dissipating figure—a long
exposure of the artist—kneeling in front of a wrinkled
burlap backdrop. This work belongs to Chong’s I-Traits
series (1979-85), which he has described as the “visual
utterances of a culturally misplaced shaman, using art
as a pretext for magic and mysticism.”” The shaman in
Minimal Mystic, even while vanishing, still conjures the
spiritual into the setting. —LAT
