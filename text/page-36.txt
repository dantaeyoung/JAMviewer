Dear

Since my initial introduction to the works of Wendy Ward
Ehlers I have been extremely supportive, amazed and excited
by her concepts and utilization of materials. I immediately
scheduled a solo exhibition of her works in the gallery and
have actively pursued the inclusion of her works in museum
and private collections. She was included in a recent book
On art being produced in the 1970s, "Contextures", as one

of the foremost artists working in a new and significant
stylistic development.

Presently I am working on traveling an exhibition of her
works to museums throughout the country during 1979 and
1980. Several dates have already been scheduled. The
exhibition will open in New York in September, 1978. I
hope you will assist Wendy in her "Lint Museum" and par-
ticipate in this exciting concept.

I am,

sneer TB
