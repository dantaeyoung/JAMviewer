Linda had recently moved to New York from
Atlanta and had two small children,

but she was brimming with ambition. Those
of us who got to know her at that point
re zed she was an unstoppable force.
The best thing we could do was help her
to keep going.

JAM volunteer, art historian, and curator

We met at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
She was a Rockefeller Fellow at the time.
I remember Linda being suspicious of
me because she viewed me as part of the
stablishment. We became much closer
she realized

and to support my work

Linda left in the middle of the

Rockefeller Fellowship. From what
I understand she was like, “I'm sick
of kissing people's behinds, bye.”

-Janet Olivia Henry
JAM volunteer and artist

There were few forums for Black artists.
Linda created dialogue not only among
artists but also with people outside
the art world.

-Horace Brockington

JAM volunteer, art historian, and curator

To our amazement, Linda got an audience
with a real estate company and got a
small space on Fifty-Seventh Street.

I convinced my brother, who was a con-
tractor at the time, to come from San
Francisco and build out the space.
Together we laid down the parquet floor
and put up walls to build this tiny
office with no windows. It was very
hands-on.

Next thing I knew, I was painting the
walls, scraping floors, tidying up
the place.

Everyone else had an agenda for what
the gallery should be, but Linda wasn’t
ihearing it.

-Horace Brockington

ILinda was always dragging me in to do some-
“thing creative. I was like, “Not my job!”

-Lowery Stokes Sims

What I remember from JAM’s first opening
sare the crowds and the curiosity factor.
IL think peop:
disbelief that this had actually hap-
ened. And you could hear a lot of the
anxiety: “Yeah, well, this won't last.”

Randy Williams

We knew how to have fun. We were young,
without much or any fear. We just said,
“Okay, how can this get done? How can we
do this?”

I always say Linda didn't try to
make Black programming equal to the
preexisting alternative art spaces.
She was doing her work, and then
everybody realized they had to catch
up with what JAM artists were doing.
Horace Brockington

Linda attracted all these different people.
Some stayed, some moved on, but JAM was
intellectual crucible for different idea:
Not everyone approved, but everybody came
around at one time or another.

away of pulling you into things.
Brockington

Linda was never prescriptive. Her exper-
imental vision allowed for a type of
dialogue that you would normally have in
a bar, but it was happening in the gallery.

-Randy Williams

I would say, “These white folks look
scared to come in here, ain’t nobody com-
here!” I was the bad guy beca
aying, “This can’t be a hangout.
Linda, you can’t have a gallon of wine
sitting on the fricking shelf, because

a few people are going to drink wine and
not go nowhere. We want visitors who come
in and then go home.” I was criticized
for having a somewhat corporate mindset,
but I was a business major.

AC Hudgins

JAM was like those prints that are off
register. Things slid to the left or the
right. The intentions were golden; the
reality was often very hand-to-mouth.
~Pat Cummings
JAM assistant director and children's
book author and illustrator

Linda upposed to be selling art, but
it turned into ‘lon and exhibition
space. She knew how to go places and get
the money, though, and she would insult
them at the same time. “Why are you
asking me to come fo! interview? You
should just be required to give me the
money anyway.”

-Horace Brockington

There were so many times that we knew it
was lights out, and a freaking grant came
through. We were just trying to keep the
lights on.

AC Hudgins

JAM created this potential for growth
that we had not si before. It also had
potential for collaboration. JAM is what
allowed for a lot of us to try things out.

Horace Brockington

The move to Franklin Street gave us an
opportunity to really engage. There were
organizations nearby that, although not
ne rily like JAM, were doing new

and radical things. As a result of that,
Iwas invited to be a part of a lot of
exhibitions. It created this extended
fenilv. and @ lot of theae orounse started

New people came in. It needed new
blood. It needed people like Blondell

Tribeca was empty. When the Food Emporium
opened, it was like, “Oh my God.”

-Kathleen Goncharov
JAM curator and artist

At JAM in Tribeca, Linda's taste wasn’t
that different. But it was a different
vibe. Being on street level downtown,
there was much more foot traffic than
there had been on Fifty-Seventh Street.
The people who came in were hell-bent
on being hip—their hair hip, their
clothes were hip.

—Pat Cummings

Anybody could sign up for a studio visit.
There was a book. You got an hour with
the curator. There was a focused, small
gallery downstairs, and big group shows
were upstairs.

Kathleen Goncharov

It was fairly cavernous, and there was
a downstairs where Linda wrote all
the grants that she needed to write to
keep the doors open.

-Maren Hassinger
artist

At times we got mad at each other.
Something would happen, we wouldn’t
talk for a while, but then—we were
in it together.

et Olivia Henry

Tribeca was a very happening area, and
sometimes celebrities came by. On more
than one occasion, Robert De Niro stuck
his h up against the window to see
what was going on.

-Waren Hassinger

My memory of JAM is all people. I
remember sitting around Linda's desk
with folks, hanging out in different
offices with folks. It was very much
about who was thi not what was
there, in a way.

~Kaylynn Sullivan TwoTrees

Broadway allowed for a different
kind of work because it was a bigger,
slicker space. But I also remember

~Kaylynn Sullivan TwoTrees

While there were people who were very
much involved in the art world, there
were also people who had various kinds
of political-resistance historie
There were moments when you felt under
si and there were also moments when
that anti-institutional,

Spirit didn’t necessarily serve
well. : sf
