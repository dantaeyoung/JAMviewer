JAM was a hub. If you were doing

off-center, fresh, and Black, y
would gravitate toward JAM.

I remember being at the apart-
ment Linda shared with her kids
and her brother. Faythe Weaver,
Pat Cummings, and | were sitting
and strategizing with Linda

about what we would now call
“branding” and “public relations.”
