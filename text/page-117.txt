A sculptor, printmaker, photographer, film-
maker, educator, and lifelong activist, Canille
Billops was a key participant in JAM throughout
its existence. By the time Billops showed in
y's inaugural exhibition, Synthesis,
, she had already begun to build Black
institutions of her own. In 1972, Billops and
her husband, James V. Hatch, established the
Hatch-Billops Archive, dedicated to preserving
and celebrating Black artists and culture.
Throughout the decade, Billops photographed
exhibitions and gatherings of Black artists in
Now York City; her pictures, including those
‘sho took at JAM (see the present volune’s jacket
and pp. 1, 4, 24-25, 30, and 47), constitute an
important archive in and of thenselves.

The artist's sculptures dismantle traditional
hierarchies between craft and fine art, at times
taking the form of furniture or other decorative
or utilitarian objects. Inspired by personal
experiences and menories, Billops animated her
sculptures with scenes that address the realities
of racism and sexism. Stylized characters
interact with their sculptural frameworks or—
as in the case of works like Nadam Puisay
(1981)—become the vessels themselves. -&8
