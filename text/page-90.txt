its neighbor Franklin Furnace, a nonprofit dedicated to
avant-garde art and artists’ books; and the performance
space 626 Bway. In addition to the artists, Hiller and
Lacy engaged two critics, Caryn Faure-Walker and Moira
Roth, to deliver a series of lectures. The public events, as
well as the private gatherings that took place between
them, were intended to provide a new context for the
participants’ artworks and to trace the links between
artists, collectives, and feminist concerns across con-
tinents—all in an effort to build broader networks for
women artists working in performance.** According
to the organizers, significant geographic differences
between the artists created fertile ground for debate:
“The London group communicates with a heavy reli-
ance on language, while the Los Angeles group empha-
sizes person-to-person confrontational performance as
ameans of communicating ideas.”** We'll Think of a Title
After We Meet, the program's original title, speaks to its
collaborative ethos.

Despite their keen awareness of the ways in which
women had been shut out of art institutions and the art
historical canon, Hiller and Lacy committed their own
act of exclusion by not including any Black artists in LA/
London Lab, an omission that bolstered the critique that
most feminist collectives and movements at the time
were not truly inclusive.2* —yK

Funded primarily by the New York State Council on
the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts, the
Creative Artists Public Service Program (CAPS), which
operated from 1970 to 1982, awarded fellowships to
New York-based artists working in a variety of disci-
plines—including painting, photography, film, dance,
theater, and literature—selected by a panel of their
peers. The Visual Arts Referral Service (VARS) came

25. The reverse of the press release
cited in the previous note features
“complete schedule of activities”
that includes “presentations” by the
Black artists Lorraine O'Grady and
Randy Williams on “the effect Just
Above Midtown-Downtown has had
on their professional and/or artistic
development.” It is unclear, however,
if these presentations ever took place.
In 1971 the first exhibition dedicated
to art by Black women, “Where We
At"—Black Women Aris, at New
York's Acts of Art gallery, spoke to
the lack of representation and support
of Black women artists in the broader
feminist community and sparked

the creation of a group by the same
name. See Kay Brown, “Where We
Av Black Women Artists," in We
