out of this program and functioned as a growing list of
CAPS fellows and other artists. VARS artists were con-
nected with donors, collectors, and galleries and pro-
vided opportunities to exhibit their work, The largest
state-supported fellowship program in the country,?*
CAPS served as a significant model for providing assis-
tance to artists.

From the Files: VARS at JAM was part of an ongo-
ing series of exhibitions featuring artists from the VARS
registry. For this iteration, which was one of the last,
JAM curator Kathleen Goncharov selected seventeen
artists from the thirty-five hundred listed. The diverse
work on display included Ana Mendieta’s “earth-
work and body art"; “three spheres” by Gary Burnley,
“painted in divided areas of color, which play on ideas
of geometry and symmetry”; and Liliana Porter's wall-
sized Parable of the Palace, made “using drawing, col-
lage and real objects arranged in a grid and creating
trompe |'oeil."” Ming Smith showed black-and-white
photographs of landscapes and cityscapes “that appear
ina soft diffused light and express a feeling of solitude,”
while Papo Colo presented “a performance piece doc-
umenting a private act and an installation displaying
documentation in serial form."** —vk
