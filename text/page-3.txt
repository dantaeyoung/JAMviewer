all children,

but she was brimming with ambition. Those
of us who got to know her at that point
realized she was an unstoppable force.
The best thing we could do was help her
to keep going.

me because she viewed me as part of the
establishment. We became much closer
‘arted talking and she realized
ki living
and to support my work as an artist.

Linda left in the middle of the

Rockefeller Fellowship. From what
I understand she was like, “I’m sick
of kissing people's behinds, bye.”

-Janet Olivia Henry
JAM volunteer and artist

There were few forums for Black artists.
Linda created dialogue not only among
artists but also with people outside
the art world.

-Horace Brockington
JAM volunteer, art historian, and curator

To our amazement, Linda got an audience
with a real estate company and got a
small space on Fifty-Seventh Street.

I convinced my brother, who was a con-
tractor at the time, to come from San
Francisco and build out the space.
Together we laid down the parquet floor
and put up walls to build this tiny
office with no windows. It was very
hands-on.

Lowery Stokes Sims

Next thing I knew, I was painting the
walls, scraping floors, tidying up
the place.

Everyone else had an agenda for what
the gallery should be, but Linda wasn’t
hearing it.

-Horace Brockington

Linda was always dragging me in to do some-
thing creative. I was like, “Not my job!”

-Lowery Stokes Sims

What I remember from JAM’s first opening
‘are the crowds and the curiosity factor.
‘I think people showed up with a sei of
(disbelief that this had actually hap-
|pened. And you could hear a lot of the
ianxiety: “Yeah, well, this won’t last.”

Randy Willia

We knew how to have fun. We were young,
without much or any fear. We just said,
“Okay, how can this get done? How can we
edo this?”

preexisting alternative art spaces.
She was doing her work, and then

everybody realized they had to catch
up with what JAM artists were doing.

-Horace Brockington

Linda attracted all these different people.
Some stayed, some moved on, but JAM was an
intellectual crucible for different ideas.
Not everyone approved, but everybody came
around at one time or another.

-Lowery Stokes Sims

Linda has a way of pulling you into things.
-Horace Brockington

Linda was never prescriptive. Her exper-
imental vision allowed for a type of
dialogue that you would normally have in
abar, but it was happening in the gallery.

Randy Williams

I would say, “These white folks look
scared to come in here, ain’t nobody ci
ing in here!” I was the bad guy becau
Iwas saying, “This can’t be a hangout.
Linda, you can’t have a gallon of wine
sitting on the fricking shelf, because
a few people are going to drink wine and
not go nowhere. We want visitors who come
in and then go home.” I was criticized
for having a somewhat corporate mindset,
but I was a business major.

AC Hudgins

JAM was like those prints that are off
register. Things slid to the left or the
right. The intentions were golden; the
reality was often very hand-to-mouth.
-Pat Cummings
JAM assistant director and children's
book author and illustrator

Linda was supposed to be selling art, but
it turned into a salon and exhibition
space. She knew how to go pl. ind get
the money, though, and she would insult
them at the same time. “Why are you
asking me to come for an interview? You
should just be required to give me the
money anyway.”

-Horace Brockington

There were so many times that we knew it
was lights out, and a freaking grant came
through. We were just trying to keep the
lights on.

AC Hudgins

JAM created this potential for growth
that we had not s fore. It also had
potential for collaboration. JAM is what
allowed for a lot of us to try things out.

-Horace Brockington

The move to Franklin Street gave us an
opportunity to really engage. There were
organizations nearby that, although not
necessarily like JAM, were doing new

and radical things. As a result of that,
I was invited to be a part of a lot of

My memory of JAM is all people.
remember sitting around Linda
with folks, hanging out in diffe
offices with folks. It was very
about who was there, not what
there, in a way.

Broadway allowed for a differen

the challenge of a bigger space,
