Mer25 Susan Mogul

The Last Jew in America
Performance, Main Gallery

Susan Mogul’s performance The Last Jew in America,
which had its premiere at JAM a few days before
Passover;* examined “processes of assimilation and
‘struggles to maintain ethnic and individual integrity.”*° It
took “the structure and the ritual of the Passover Seder” as
its starting point, with the traditional retelling of the story
of the Israelites’ liberation from enslavement replaced by
Mogul’s irreverent and absurdist monologue, which she
deliveredin the role of “The Last Jew,” “part professor, part
night club comic.”*” Among the topics addressed were the
lack of great Jewish art and artists, Jewish Americans’ rela-
tionship to Chinese food, celebrities whose Jewish her-
itage isn’t well-known, and intermarriage. The rambling
Narrative was punctuated by the introduction of props
including a Sammy Davis Jr. album, across, and handcuffs;
these functioned like the food items on the Seder plate,
each of which represents an aspect of the Passover sto-
ry.** She was one of several artists whose performances at
JAM addressed their lived experience and the labor and
care needed to maintain aspects of their identity.

55. The performance date’s proximity
to the holiday gave Mogul the idea
for this new work. She would goon
to perform various iterations of The
Last Jevo in America, primatily in 1983
and 1984, at other alternative art
spaces, a small theater in Hollywood,
New York's Jewish Museum, and
‘SummerStage in Central Park.
