the first exhibition that they

were all out in the stree
They couldn't even get on the
elevator to get up. And if you ©
got up, you couldn't get down
because it was just full o
people. There was now!
to go. I'm surprised that '
didn’t call the fire department
and make everybody leave.

JAM was an experimental
alternative space where
anything went. You could do

any thing if you could figure
out how to do it.
