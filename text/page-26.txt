DAVID BOXER: Diptychs, Triptychs, and Polyptychs

NANCY PRAGER: Atmospheric Landscapes
March 10 = March 29

Two individual, solo exhibits will be on view from
March 10 until March 29. A public opening will be
held in the gallery on March 10th from 5 until 7 PM.

In a series of monoprints, Atmospheric Landscapes, MSe
Prager sensitively explores the "menta errain once
visited or still sought". Her interpretative abstractions
employ subtle coloring and the careful interplay of forms

to suggest landscapes.

A recent recipient of the Prix de Paris, Ms. Prager's
work is included in the collection of the United Nations.

An ultimate concern for the human condition permeates the
work of David Boxer. Considered as tragedian at times,
Boxer's paintings, which are characterized by pertinent
juxtapositions of "found" and "created" images, as well

as the use of a variety of media are evidence of the artist's
intensive insights and curiosity.

In regard to his exhibit, Diptychs, Triptychs, and Polyptychs
David Boxer states, "I allow private myths to nurture a
universal purpose, in the same sense that Beethoven did

or for that matter that Francis Bacon does in his paintings -
but the sense of personal myth in Bacon's work is a bit
stronger than in my own. I see my current position as

being somewhere between Bacon and Giacommetti. I ravage

my psyche to arrive at truths about the real nature of man...
