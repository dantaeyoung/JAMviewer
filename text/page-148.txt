The Critic's Choice was the first and only set of perfor-
‘mances realized as part of what was envisioned as an
annual series showcasing artists selected by a group
of critics and producers. Presented at the Village
Gate, a Greenwich Village nightclub, this "music fe:
tival with a twist” featured “new concepts” from per
formers chosen in response to the question “What's
new among artists of color?"” Writers Michael Alan.
Gonzales, Greg Tate, and Peter Watrous, among others,
generated lists from which the final roster was developed.
The resulting suite of shows spanned jazz, gospel, accor-
dion, and electronic sounds, creating an ecstatic musical
experience—and serving as yet another example of JAM's
‘commitment to supporting experimental and emerg-
ling artists who were rarely platformed elsewhere. (The
Shared Resources program, which ran from 1985 to 1986,
offered free space for rehearsals and performances, and
made JAM on Broadway the first venue to present the
work of several artists.)

;cond night of the festival, Graham Haynes
and No Image played work guided by the Brooklyn-based
‘movement M-Base’s philosophy of sound making, which
utilized improvisation to create expressive music derived

group formed by Haynes
‘and Coleman in 1979 that turned ordinary funkon itshead
by breaking from traditional song structure and using,
pop and jaz sounds. The band 24-7 Spyz, which had per-
formed earlier the same evening, aimed to be “the first
Of [thele] kind to cross boundaries of musical thought. To
play for all races, creeds, colors and to be accepted by

all’ In this pursuit the group blended reggae, heavy
metal, soul, funk, and thrash to develop a genre of its
‘own. Hailing from the Bronx, 24-7 Spyz's four members
‘were involved in the Black Rock Coalitionfounded by
‘Grog Tate, Konda Mason, and Vernon Reld (who also per-
formed in Critic's Choiee)—which sought to encourage
the creative liberation of Black artists whose work didnt
fitthe music industry's stereotypes of “Black music” (see
Chronology, p. 158). —v«
