Aaron Bell. Souvenir print
marking the inauguration of
Just Above Midtown, signed

by individuals involved with
the gallery at the time. 1974.
Edition: 200

Possessing a keen understand-
ing of the integral role of
branding, Linda Goode Bryant
commissioned JAM's logo from
Aaron Bell, a young designer who
would go on to have a decades-
long career as an art director
at UniWorld, one of the first
and most prominent Black-owned
advertising firms in New York.
The resulting design, in which
san-serif letters form asym-
metrical concentric curves,
conveys informality, rhythm,
and collectivity. It served as
the gallery's primary graphic
identity for many years. —BE
