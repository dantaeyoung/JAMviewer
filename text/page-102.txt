Another work in this category was The Fine Art of
Waitressing, performed by Madeleine Keller and Janet
Ziff in June 1982 in conjunction with the exhibition What
1 Do for Art (see Chronology, p. 101). Their “multimedia
presentation”*® included a carousel of slides that shed
light on the politics of the service industry, a dramatiza-
tion of interviews with two veteran waitresses, a filmed
demonstration on “The Proper Way to Clear a Table,”
and a fashion show of aprons designed by Ziff.*° The
press release stated that Keller first waited tables at the
SoHo restaurant FOOD; her waitressing career ended
when she was fired from another downtown restau-
rant for her “alleged vulnerability,” an admission that
highlights the emotional labor required of all service
workers. Ziff, on the other hand, was still a waitress and
investing energy into gaining new skills, having recently
returned from a trip to the Riviera to research French
table service.” The Fine Art of Waitressing, whose title
plays with the idea that there is an art to any occupation,
might be understood in relation to the notion of “main-
tenance art.” Formulated by Mierle Laderman Ukeles in
1969, the term offers a critique of art as an elitist realm
of individual creation and elevates the less glamorous
tasks that support and preserve cultural production—in
this case, the non-art labor performed by artists so that
they could afford to be artists at all.°? —tr
