Other artists visited the residents and inevitably the\nconversations turned to discussions about the challenges they faced in trying to\nget their work shown because, as they putit, \u201cThey won't let us, they won't let\nus.\u201d And | found myself saying, \u201cFuck them. Let's just do it ourselves.\u201d\n\nto Who were \u201cthey\u201d in 1974?\n\n198 The whole infrastructure of the established art world:\ncritics, collectors, galleries, museums, other art spaces,\nart historians.\n\nT@ And who were you in 1974?\n\n108 I'm pausing because I'm going to say the first thing that\ncame to mind. | wasa nationalist. | think I've always beena\nBlack nationalist. | still am. And what does that mean for me?\nEvery day, I'm bowled over by the resourcefulness, imagina-\ntion, and creativity of Black folk. Wherever there is Black\npresence, it\u2019s there. And I\u2019ve always just wanted to be around\nthat, to be part of that, to support that.\n\nThere's so much that we're faced with that can cause us\nto doubt ourselves or to think we don\u2019t exist exceptas the\nflip side of a black-and-white coin. And | just go, \u201cNo, look at\nour beauty and amazingness. How can you even doubt that?\u201d\n| feel that these days\u2014and I\u2019m ancient now, soit could be\ngenerational\u2014there\u2019s a notion that Black exists in the absence\nof white, and that\u2019s bullshit. Black exists in the presence of\nBlackness. We exist\u2014what we are, who we are, our power\u2014in\nour presence, not in the absence of white folks.\n\nT@ This is one of the most profound aspects of JAM\u2019s origin\nstory and of your vision. Black institutions\u2014and specifically\nBlack art institutions\u2014are always seen as in response to. That\ncrystallized for me during an encounter we had with one\n\nof the many people in our professional world who had recently\ndiscovered the history of our culture and JAM's place within\nit. This person kept talking about JAM in relation to what was\nhappening in galleries or in museumsat that time. And you\nvery calmly but fiercely said, \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a reaction to that.\nItwasa total, complete world and idea unto itself.\" Itwas\nthe most profound mental and ideological shift around the\nnotion of cultural specificity. As someone who has traveled.\nthrough many specifically Black institutions\u2014the Black\nchurch, Spelman College, the Studio Museum\u2014can you talk\nabout this idea of an autonomous Black space versus a\nreactionary one?\n\n108 JAM was an autonomous Black space because it was\nabout our ideas, our visions, our creativity, the things we\nmade, the things we felt, the relationships we created that\nsupported us as individuals and collectively. But when!\nthink back, it also had to do with the moment, when | wasa\nchild, that it occurred to me that | was an artist. And there\nwere probably two things that caused that self-realization.\n\nThe first one occurred when | was staying at my paternal\ngrandmother's house. | noticed that she had a tendency\n\nto. go downstairs into the\nkitchen early in the morning.\nOne morning | heard her get\nout of bed and go down-\nstairs, and I decided to go\ndownstairs too. | followed\nher and attempted to open\nthe door. It was locked, and\n\\hadn\u2018t remembered it ever\nbeing closed. Then | heard\nthis noise that sounded like\nsand being thrown against\nthe wall. | lay down on my\nstomach and looked under\nthe door. | could see what looked like a white pit of salt, and\n\n\\ could smell vinegar. | called, \u201cGrandma Goode, let mein,\n\nlet mein.\u201d But she wouldn't. She was singing. | understood\nthat there was some magic going on behind that door, and\n\nI wanted to be part of it. Later | processed why she hadn\u2019'tlet\nme in. She was Pentecostal. When | came out of the womb,\nmy parents gave me to her. | was raised in the Pentecostal\nChurch, which is ritualistic. I'm very much still attached to\nthat\u2014notthe doctrine but the culture of it. Butinto her\nChristianity my grandmother incorporated some rituals she\nhad learned growing up in South Carolina. Her parents were\nslaves, and she was part of the first generation born out of\nslavery. That was an awakening for me in terms of creativity\nand imagination\u2014\n\nT@ Andalsoa Black specificity. Right?\n\ntoa Yes.\n\n7\u00b0 Because what she was holding was a specific way of being\nBlack in relation to formalized Black institutional structures.\nYou then revised that relation for yourself. You stepped away\nfrom the Pentecostal Church for various reasons. You had to\nstep away from historically Black colleges and universities,\nparticularly the women\u2019s colleges of that era. You then had to\nstep away from the Studio Museum of that era. You've often\nsaid you wanted to have a space that would allow for risk and\nexperimentation. Why was that important?\n\n108 Before | get to that, | need to describe the second thing in\nmy young life that made me realize | was an artist: Mr. Dillard\u2019s\ngarage. The Dillards were family friends. | was friends with\ntheir five kids. Mr. Dillard had a garage and, once again, it was\nlocked. And | was just fascinated by that garage. One day\nlasked him, \u201cCan I go into the garage?\u201d And he responded,\n\norposrTe Linda Goode B\n\u00a2. 1974. Photographs\nDwight Cartor\n\nBELOW Linda Goode Bry\nternal grandmother\n\nGo\n\n", "10": "\u201cNo, you can\u2019t go into the garage.\u201d But that didn\u2019t stop me\nfrom asking the next time | went over. \u201cHey, Mr. Dillard, can\nI go into the garage?\u201d \u201cNo, you can\u2019t go into the garage.\u201d And\none day | said, \u201cMr. Dillard, | really want to go into the garage.\u201d\n\u2018And he went, \u201cYou can come into the garage today,\u201d and he\nopened it. He had collected things that people had discarded,\nfrom dolls to broken chairs, to car parts, to whatever, and he\nmade them live again through the most amazing magic. And\ntome that was like, \u201cIf you can take something that people\nthink has no value and make it have life again... that's artand\nI'm an artist. That's what | wantto do.\u201d\n\nUsing what you have to create what you need is some-\nthing that people who don\u2019t have financial resources do\nina world that is driven by money. You have to take what\nyou have to create what you need, and what you create is\nsomething that\u2019s coming out of you, your spirit, your soul,\nand your passion as life force. So anyway, those are two\nlong stories.\nAmazing. Eventually, you come to the idea of starting a\ngallery. You're at the Studio Museum, but you know you want\nto open a space. You havea sense of a vision of who the\n\u2018space is for. You make the decision, based on what you\nwant to create, to geta space on Fifty-Seventh Street, and you\nmanage to geta lease. Can you describe the first space,\nwhatit looked like and meant to be on Fifty-Seventh Street?\n198 There were three offices on our floor. One was a fabric\nstore and one was Mario, who was the tailor for everybody,\nfrom Walt Frazier to Miles Davis. On one of the upper floors\nthere wasa recording studio, Decca. Miles used to record\nthere and then come down to the tailor. JAM\u2019s space was in\nthe middle, and it was 724 square feet. It was small. The win-\ndows had been covered up, which | thought was perfect fora\ngallery. The floor was linoleum. It hadn\u2019t been used in along\ntime because nobody really wanted a space that small in\nbetween two bigger spaces. Allan Frumkin, who was a major\nart dealer at that time, was on the second floor. Terry Dintenfass\nwasin the building. There were other galleries in the building.\nArtists and friends came to help to lay parquet flooring and\nbuild out JAM\u2019s space.\nT@ And the first exhibition?\n198 It was called Synthesis, and it was a group exhibition that\nfeatured artists who were working in the abstract continuum\nof Western art, and also those working in a more figurative\nand representational continuum [see Chronology, p. 29].\nEven though my inclinations definitely leaned toward experi-\nmental work, it took me a couple years to goin that direction,\nBecause | did feel a lot of pressure from artists. New York\nartists. Benny Andrews, Camille Billops, and Vivian Browne\ncould be very convincing.\n1? When JAM opened, there was a demand to be representa-\n\u2018tional, both from figures in the previous generation, like Romare\nBearden, and from the peers of the artists you were showing.\nCan you talk a bit about the landscape of that moment?\ntos. In terms of the Black community, there was fierce debate,\nbetween artists making representational art and those mak-\ning nonrepresentational work, about the definition of Black\nart. What was Black art? Were artists who made nonrepre-\nsentational work \u201cBlack artists\u201d? And there wasa kind of rivalry\nbetween artists based on where they lived, between New\nYork and California artists, anda more subtle one between\nLos Angeles and Bay Area artists. Of course, there were Black\nartists working throughout the country, notably in Chicago,\n\noa ee\n\nBoston, and DC, and they were also part of the conversation.\nSo when | decided JAM was going to show artists based in\nNew York, California, and elsewhere, New York City artists\nmade their objections known.\n\nMost Black-run art organizations in Manhattan, Brooklyn,\nand Queens tended to exhibit representational work, which\nIcalled \u201cred-green-and-black\u201d or \u201cBlack-women-nursing-\nbabies\u201d art because those were common elements. It was\nconsidered nationalist art. | identified as a nationalist, but!\nwasn't drawn to that aesthetic. Artist-run organizations such\nas Tom Lloyd's Store Front Museum in Queens, Weusi-Nyumba\nYa Sanaa Gallery in Harlem, and Where We At Black Women\nArtists created opportunities for Black artists to meet and show\ntheir work. I was at the Studio Museum, and while it was a vi-\nbrant space, especially for artists, people who walked by the\nmuseum every day or lived across the street were not coming\nin. wanted more of them to come into the museum. JAM was\non Fifty-Seventh Street, and Black folks didn\u2019t usually come\nto Fifty-Seventh Street then. So engaging folks at JAM who\nweren't going into museums was complicated.\n\nT@ Youwere trying to create a different model separate from\nthe ways the \u201ccommunity\u201d\u2014we put that in quotes\u2014was_\nimagined to engage with art, and in direct response to what\nBlack artists wanted and needed at that time. Can you talk\nabout the exhibition openings at JAM? Because that would\nallow us to then talk about how you created this space that\nwas different from anything else. | have lived with the stories\nof those legendary openings, which were the meetings of\n\nso many worlds and people, not just in the art world, but in\nmusic, fashion, film.\n\n18 The cross-fertilization in that little seven-hundred-square-\nfoot space was amazing because every segment of the Black\ncommunity came in.

And people didn\u2019t just\ncome to the openings; people hung out at the gallery and\ncame by frequently. It was kind of like the Artist-In-Residence\nprogram at the Studio Museum when | was thera, Folks were\nthere sharing ideas, relating to one another, being creative,\nand just being human together. But the mix at JAM was more\ndiverse than at the Studio.\n\nAnd then there were the debates, including the one at\nDavid Hammons's first solo show at JAM [see Chronology,\np. 33]. | first saw the work when it arrived, and | said, \u201cHmm,\nthis may need some explanation,\u201d Sol asked Lowery [Stokes\nSims] to write something that we could hand out to people\nif they wanted it. She wrote this piece that had her humor in\nit; she could have done stand-up. And when David got there\nright before people arrived and saw Lowery\u2019s text ona\npodium by the door, he said, \u201cWhatis this?\u201d \u201cRead it.\"\"You\ncan't describe the work to somebody. They have to see this\nthemselves.\u201d He told me to get rid of Lowery\u2019s essay and | did.\nThis opening was one of JAM\u2019s largest openings. People\nwere outside, down in the stairwells, in the lobby, and out the\nbuilding\u2014almost as many people as there had been atthe\n\u2018opening of JAM's first exhibit. People were coming in expect-\ning to see body prints, but there weren't any. David told me\nhe wasn't making more body prints. Instead, he was making\nwork with brown paper bags, barbecue bones, grease,\nand hair. Abstract and figurative artists came and talked about\nthe work in their different \u201ctribes.\u201d Artists in both groups\nwere angered by the work. Some confronted David, asking,\n\u201cWhat the fuck is this shit, man?\u201d He just stared and didn\u2019t\nsay anything. The tension in the room kept building. Finally,\nasked everybody to sit down, shut up, and have a conver-\nsation. Things got heated. First people said, \u201cYou can\u2019t make\nart with barbecue bones and hair. Thisisn\u2019t art.\u201d But after a\nwhile someone asked, \u201cWell, why not? Why are you objecting\nto what he\u2019s making art with? Why's that a problem?\u201d Those\nwords kind of sat there until a few more people said, \u201cWait a\nminute. Yeah, why not?\u201d\nTo Whatisso apparent\u2014particularly in that \u201874 to \u201878 period,\nin that set of exhibitions and your first exhibition with David\u2014\nis that you were creating the ground for what we now think of\nas Black conceptual art, not in relation to a debate about fig-\nuration and abstraction, which had ruled the conversations\nabout Black art for so long, but as this other space that was so\nmuch more expansive and tied to risk and experimentation.\n\nCan you talk about what it meant to be a woman gallerist\ninthat moment, particularly in relation to race? How did you\nnavigate this Black cultural space from the perspective of\nbeing a woman?\n198 | experienced a lot of hostility from some of the gallerists\nonFifty-Seventh. Some of them couldn't pass up an opportu-\nnity to say something insulting when we were forced to be in\nthe elevator or the lobby together. A lot of them were angry\nwith Bill Judson for renting the space to me\u2014Black and single\nwith two kids.\n\nThere were a few galleries supportive of me being there.\nFemale dealers extended themselves: Terry Dintenfass\nand Betty Parsons, mostly through Jack Tilton, who was\nworking for her. They shared how hard it was to be a female\ninthis business. The men didn\u2019t show us the same respect\nthey showed each other. The women talked about that and\nacknowledged how difficult it was for me to be Black and\nfemale.

That's how I've\nalways been. | can\u2019t be fixated on that.\n10 One of your goals with Just Above Midtown was to bring\nmore awareness about Black artists to audiences and collec-\ntors. One of the ways you achieved this was through JAM\u2019s\nmelding of the commercial and the nonprofit.\n\u2018oa We opened as a commercial gallery in 1974 but applied\nfor and secured nonprofit status in 1975. In JAM\u2019s early years,\nIwas very interested in cultivating Black collectors and\ncreating an infrastructure that would enable our community\nto support the art being made. Being on Fifty-Seventh Street\nprovided us with access to Black professionals who worked\nin Midtown and had discretionary income. Ivan Karp, who\nowned O.K. Harris Gallery, advised me on this when | was a\nRockefeller Fellow at the Met. As part of the fellowship, we\ngot to meet him and other people working in the arts. At\nsome point during our visit with him, he stopped the visit and\nsaid to me, \u201cCome with me.\u201d He took me downstairs, and he\nbegan to break down the art world for me. He explained that\nartis social thing.\n\nA few years later, when I decided to open the gallery, |\nkept hearing white dealers argue that the reason they didn\u2019t\nshow African American artists was that they would not know\n\ntitdla teonete tiryanit eof\nHirdonides te yanity ae tes\nafi oxtithi ton opening\nStudd Mannion Str Have Ni\nsnd A.

An artist had to come to\ndinner with the collector and, these white dealers\u2019 argu-\nment went, Black artists would be uncomfortable with white\ncollectors. Which was bizarre. Like, what would happen? We\nwouldn't know how to use a fork? Wouldn't be able to speak\nthe language? Sometimes people say the most offensive shit\nand reveal themselves in the process.\n\nIvan Karp telling me art was a social thing helped me\nunderstand that there's strategy underneath, that selling art\nis relationship-based. At JAM, what | said was, \u201cHow are we\ngoing to bring people together?\u201d Well, we all know that food\nis a good way to get people arounda table. So, the Brunch\nwith JAM series was one way to do that [see Chronology, p. 36].\n\u2018Away for more people to know about JAM and to build new\nrelationships.\n\n0 Explain Brunch with JAM.\n\n198 Brunch with JAM was when we would offer lunch fora\nfew dollars. Faythe Weaver, a dear friend who had done the\nWhitney Independent Study Program and was questioning\nwhether she was going to stay in the art world or do something\nelse, was a great cook and would make meals and bring them\nto the gallery. We would advertise with flyers. AC Hudgins was\nworking at JAMand became the flyer man, passing out flyers\non the street at seven o'clock in the morning, before people\nwent to their offices. In addition to being the cheapest lunch\nonthe block, it was also homemade and delicious, plus you got\nalecture from a curator, historian, or critic.\n\nT\u00ae You were doing public programs along with the curatorial\nprograms. You had earned income from the lunches. All of\nthat speaks again to this shape-shifting model. You figured\nout what was needed and then operated within that, as\n\u2018opposed to just grafting the available models. You used the\nmodel of the gallery butin the least literal way possible.\n\nta These Black professionals were coming to the gallery,\nalong with every Black model that was walking a runway,\nbackup singersin all of these bands, entertainment attorneys\nat CBS and ABC. They would come in and buy Palmer Hayden\nworks and David's body prints because while they were\nabstract, they were also figurative. Brunch with JAM became\nSunday brunches with collectors and artists. There were only\na few, but they were key. Black collectors would come and\nfeel comfortable asking, \u201cHow do | know if it\u2019s good?\u201d They\nwould talk with artists about their work, and artists would\nusually reply, \u201cIf you like it, it's good.\u201d Conversations devel-\noped into relationships that led to people feeling comfortable\nat JAM. Gallery spaces were once alien to us, because we\nwere excluded from them. JAM was home.\n\nT@ {love the way you've conjured the sense of community\nthat was created across these different sectors. In 1980, JAM\nmoved to Tribeca. What was the reason for that move?\n\n168 Our landlord, Bill Judson, who owned part of 50 West\nFifty-Seventh Street, sold his share of the building, which\nwas then transferred to new owners. | understand from his\nattorney that he tried like hell to negotiate for JAM to stay\nthere, so much so that the new owners said | used juju on Bill.\nThe new owner said, \u201cWe're not buying this juju.\u201d So we had\ntomove.\n\nT\u00ae And how did you land in Tribeca? How did you find that\n\u2018space?\n\ntee I started looking downtown. For one, we were showing\nexperimental work, and moving downtown would provide\nartists at JAM with the opportunity to cross-fertilize with\n\nSlo @ COR ee eee\n\nBELOW Bill T. Jones, David\nHammons, and Philip Mallory\nJones during rehearsals for\ntheir performance Naming\nThings: A Collaboration, at\ndust Above Midtown/Downtorn,\nFranklin Street, 1983\n\nother experimental artists. We could also lease more space\ndowntown for less money. At the same time, | wondered,\n\u201cWhat Black folks are going to come to Tribeca?\u201d That was a\nconcern, to be honest with you. It was one thing tocome to\nFifty-Seventh Street; it was another thing to go downtown\n\nat that time. But ultimately | had faith that Black folks would\ncontinue to come to JAM no matter where it was. So | started\nlooking for space downtown.\n\nMany of the buildings in Tribeca were used for manufac-\nturing. There was a business that ground coffee all day. Some\nbuildings housed chicken coops; you could smell eggs and\nshit. That was Tribeca. The space we ended up in had been\nameat-packer, soit was refrigerated. Artists, friends, and\ncolleagues came to help us dismantle the refrigeration with\ncrowbars. It was a bitch of a motherfucker, but we pulled\n\u2018out walls to clear space. I'll never forget when Marcia Tucker\nand Dean McNeil, her longtime partner at the time, helped\ndemolish the refrigeration and offices in the space. | still have\nthat crowbar somewhere. You could lease Tribeca space\n\u2018onthe cheap. The people buying up those manufacturing\nbuildings anticipated that professionals would move to\nthe neighborhood. That's the age-old New York story: Artists\ngoin first and we invest all of our know-how, moxie, and cre-\nativity to transform that space into something desirable. And\nthen the real estate developers make a whole bunch of money.\nT@ And give the neighborhood the \u201csensibility.\u201d People clear-\nly came to the Tribeca space. It also seems that the program\nshifted. Can you talk about what, why, and how?\n\n168 The start of that shift ties back to one of the earlier\nshows at JAM, Statements Known and Statements New [see\nChronology, p. 36]. It wasn\u2019t enough that JAM was on Fifty-\nSeventh Street; it was also important to put Black artists in\nexhibitions with their white counterparts and let individual\nor collective eyes decide if there was really a difference in\nthe quality of the work. There were white artists who showed\nat JAM when we were on Fifty-Seventh Street. Moving to\nTribeca allowed me to explore that more. We now had a\nstreet-level space and the basement, which we converted\n\nopposite Just Above Midtown/\nCorporation for Art and\nTelevision, Broadway,\njovation, c, 1984-86\n\na a <\n\n", "13": "into offices and a small gallery. JAM had the physical capacity\ntopresent dance, performance art, and media and to expand\nthe number of artists we showed.\n\n10 Talk about some of the exhibitions or performances there\nthat typified the ethos of JAM at that moment.\n\ntos Experimentation and new works created through collab-\noration by artists who had not previously worked with one\nanother. A representation of the ethos\u2014atits best and atits\nworst\u2014was the collaboration between Bill T. Jones, Philip\nMallory Jones, and David Hammons [see Chronology, p. 108].\nThat was a hootin so many ways. | believe it was the first time\nthere was cross-disciplinary collaboration among Black male\nartists\u2014and that kind of collaboration was what interested\nme. And everything that could happen did happen, and\nthings I could not have imagined happened. Bill T. Jones:\n\u201cParadiso! Paradiso!\u201d David Hammons: \u201cI\u2019m not saying that.\nI'm not saying that.\u201d \u201cDavid, you have to say \u2018Paradiso!\u2019\u201d David\njust sits back.\n\nTo That's why we wish there was a video of it! There's that\none great photo of Bill on the ground and David, but to imag-\nine what it would have been like . .. In your definition of the\ninstitution, which seems to have carried through the different\nlocations, was the ability to have space not just for presenta-\ntion but for making. In general, collaboration seems to be at\nthe heart of all of your work. Talk about collaboration as it re-\nlates to how you imagine artists working together, or how you\nworked with artists, or how you built a sense of community.\n108 Wellive in social structures; our society divides every-\nthing. We belong to this department or this division. And\nwhat this means for an artist\u2014and I experienced this asa film-\nmaker more than ever\u2014is that you are often only understood\nas conveying something when you're doing so according to\nthe box you happen to find yourself in.\n\nOne of the wonderful things | like about filmmaking are\nwork-in-progress screenings. When you do them, you need to\ncreate an environment where people are comfortable being\nhonest. It doesn\u2019t work if people aren't honest. You letthem.\ntalk. If you're the artist, you fucking don\u2019t talk. Listen to people\nwho have looked at and engaged in what you're doing, and\nfind out what you can learn about yourself and about the\nwork from their feedback. You'll know instantly whether or\nnot you told the story the way you thought you told the story.\n\nCollaboration for me is the experience of creating\nrelationships of honesty, which requires a certain level of\ntrust. It's not about ego, which seems to be more and more\non display these days. A good collaboration happens when\nthe collaborators are all about the work, not their egos.\nCollaboration is key, essential. And you grow, because the\nideas are going \u201cch-ch-ch-ch-ch!\u201d and that personis bringing\nup something that sparks something else that sparks some-\nthing else. And the next thing you know, what had been the\ncore idea is expanding in ways that are far more interesting\nthan you, as an individual, imagined.\n\nT Collaboration and collective experience. Up until this mo-\nment, when Just Above Midtown has been brought back into\npublic view, most of us have known it through the collective\nmemories, the narratives, of the people who were there.\n\nSo Franklin Street was the second location, anditledtoa\nmove to SoHo. What prompted that?\n\n8 The top two floors in our Tribeca building were residential\nand owned by two of the building's owners. And why was that\naproblem? Because we did performances at night, and they\n\nanya Bt:\n\nwere loud, so they got fed up. They had a meeting and they\nvoted to terminate our lease. So our landlord said, \u201cYou've\ngotto move.\u201d\n\nWe had an office space for about six months on Lafayette\nStreetas | looked for a new place. Manufacturing buildings on\nBroadway were starting to be developed into offices and re-\ntail spaces. There was this space at 503 Broadway, top floor,\namazing skylights, twenty-five thousand square feet. The\nbuilding was mostly being rented to sweatshops. The top\nfloor was unoccupied. And my God, the rats were as big as\nbig cats. It was in bad shape. So | was able to negotiate alow\nrent compared to other buildings on Broadway at that time.\nTe Twenty-five thousand square feet! How did Just Above\nMidtown change in that moment?\ntow | had this notion that the nextiteration of JAM was going\nto have production facilities equivalent toa production\nstudio, similar to the Astoria or Silvercup film studios, for\ntwo reasons: financial and creative [see Chronology, p.151].\nI wanted to provide artists with the opportunity to work\nwithout the burden of exhibiting. At this point it was becom-\ning increasingly clear that the focus for dealers was to court\nand seduce Wall Street people into becoming collectors. |\nwanted JAM to provide artists with the ability to be creative,\nexperiment, and just fart if they wanted to fart as a way of\nprocessing what their next thing was going to be. That possi-\nbility was being reduced, and it was going to continue to\nshrink. | thought perhaps JAM shouldn't be showing work but\nshould bea laboratory for artists to push their work beyond\nits current boundaries. That was the tagline. And to do that,\n| wanted to also incorporate all of the new technology\nemerging in film, video, animation, and sound,\n\nJAM programs became labs where artists worked for one\nor two months in one of two very large open areas. We\nprovided them with a monthly stipend so they wouldn't have\nto simultaneously wait tables or drive a cab or whatever.\nAnd then we turned the other half of the space into artists\u2019\nstudios and offices for small arts entities and artists to rent.\nThe goal was to take over the entire building and transform\n\n", "14": "itinto.a major production facility. I'm always interested in\nhow we can generate the revenue we need to support artists\nand creativity.\n\n\u2018The other factor was that Hollywood was coming. | knew\nthe film industry was going to come back to New York\nbecause it was this cyclical thing film and television did, and\nIhad been reading up on that. And | said, \"Whoa, wouldn\u2019tit\nbe really wild for productions not to have to go to Queens and ee\nget caught in all that fucking traffic?\u201d My daughter was an |\nactress, so | had to go to Silvercup.

What prompted Ls i\nthat?\n\nlos A number of things coalesced from different interest\ngroups that led ultimately to JAM\u2019s closing asa physical\nspace. The first was that the realtors and developers who\nwere developing Broadway were really upset because | was,\nrenting out space at a lower per-square-foot rate than the\nrate they charged. So they started complaining to the IRS\nand saying, \u201cIt\u2019s unfair competition,\u201d because | could get\ngrants to subsidize and lower rent, and that was limiting their\nability to compete.

And, as you already said, you got\ncaught in what were these shifting neighborhoods. So when\nJAM closed its physical space, what was your vision then?\nBecause clearly you kept the idea of what it was alive.\n\n108 My vision then was to take it to the streets. I've always\nbelieved that people should be able to discover and engage\nwith art during the course of daily life. And don\u2019t mean\npublic art installations. It goes back to Mr. Dillard, for sure.\nBut David has done that in his work, with the wine bottles,\nbasketball hoops, and what we now call \u201cinterventions.\u201d He\nwould do things on sidewalks, in lots, on the beach in LA,\nand people would discover them. And I'ma firm believer\n\nin that, There were a number of ideas for projects that\ninvolved interdisciplinary work. There were JAM concerts\n\nin Mount Morris Park before it was renovated; it was a very\nsketchy place. Butch Morris introduced me to Michael Dorf,\nwho was starting the Knitting Factory at that time, and we\nprogrammed some concerts there. We presented jazz musi-\ncians ata club in Greenwich Village [see Chronology,\n\np. 160].\n\n1\u00b0 Youcontinued to program and to engage, but you also\nhada life in urban planning. You entered the administration\nof New York City\u2019s first Black mayor, David Dinkins. And then\neventually you began to think about your path asa filmmaker.\n\nLet's talk about the current exhibition. How does it feel\nto think in the present day about the history of Just Above\nMidtown through the forum of an exhibition at The Museum\nof Modern Art?\nl8 My thinking is based on what I call the show's premise:\ncan JAM\u2014how can JAM\u2014be JAM at MoMA? Thatis a chal-\nlenge. Can Black presence be in this white space? We're\nthinking imaginatively and creatively in ways that allow the\nenergy that you've helped me to talk about today surface and\nask what JAM would do in that space.\n\nAnd | should say this to you because | don\u2019t know that!\never have. You brought up the idea of me doing the JAM show\nmany years ago. You were insistent and persistent in the way\nthat only Thelma can be. That really stuck with me. Especially\nwhen you said, \u201cDon\u2019t you wantto tell this story? You don't\nwant somebody else to tell this story.\u201d That would floatin\nand out of my head for years. The other thing that led me to\ndo the show was trying to find the can in can't. I've lived life\nfinding the can in can't. | believe if we're willing to do that,\nwe can make this happen. So, knock on wood, that\u2019s what's\nhappened\u2014JAM at MoMA being JAM.\n\nTo |t\u2019snotjust the importance of you having to tell JAM's\nstory, JAM\u2019s many stories, but also because in so many ways,\nIsee very clearly how, from your time in Black institutions,\nincluding the Studio Museum, to the creation of Just Above\nMidtown, you set the groundwork for everything we are living\nright now, We can trace those lines. In many ways you created\nthat generational break\u2014the conversations you engaged in\n\nwith that generation of artists created this big open space for\na whole other generation of artists.\n\nTo ask if JAM can be JAM at MoMA is really to ask the big-\nger questions about these Black autonomous spaces: What\nare they? What can they be? To me, JAM was a utopia that we\nare trying to reach again in all these different manifestations\nof Black space, The story of JAM makes clear that even when\nJAM closed its physical space it remained this deep spiritual\nspace that people engaged with and still hold up. What this\nbrings us to is a way for the exhibition to catalyze new ideas\nabout institutions, organizations, ways to be, which is all that\nyou have givenus.\n\nBut finally, what I'll say, Linda, is that so much of JAM\u2019s\nstory, and your story in terms of your path, is about this idea\nof creation. The creation of self as an individual but alsoasa\ncommunity. Can you talk about where in your life this impetus,\nspirit, and deep politic of self-creation comes from?\n\n108 Definitely from the neighborhood | grew up in. | was born\na few years after World War II, when Black people had moved\ninto higher paying and more professionally bent jobs because\nthe white men were out to war. White people moved out of\nmy neighborhood and others like it when Black people moved\nin. We were self-supporting and contained. There was a\ncross section of Black folks all living together, economically,\nprofessionally, politically. And because we weren't being\nprovided services by the state\u2014when a community becomes\npredominantly Black, services go away\u2014we had to do that for\nourselves. So that certainly was formative. | think about how\nstrong that network was.\n\nTo That sense of the communal. | alwaysask you this, but!\nhave to say it again. How did you do this? You were a single\nmother, raising your two kids among the art and artists.

At the time, the discourse among Black artists\nin New York was often framed in terms of the opposition\nbetween figuration and abstraction.\u2019 Likewise, there was\na split between artists living in New York and those living\neverywhere else, with mainstream exhibition opportuni-\nties for the latter few and far between.? Synthesis included\nworks in a wide range of styles by both established New\nYork artists (Camille Billops, Vivian Browne, Norman Lewis,\nand Valerie Maynard) and emerging ones (Russ Thompson\nand Randy Williams) as well as by a younger generation\nof artists based in Los Angeles (Dan Concholar, Alonzo\nDavis, David Hammons, and Suzanne Jackson). Elizabeth\nCatlett was the sole artist living abroad, in Mexico.\n\nAmong the most imposing works in the show were\ntwo abstract paintings by Lewis, No. 2 (1973; plate 3)\nand No. 7 (1973), the former featuring a primarily black\ncomposition enriched by colorful undertones and white\nlines, some made with chalk, others the result of the artist\nblocking off parts of the canvas before applying pigment.\nJackson's MaeGame (1973; plate 1), another large-scale\npainting that was on display, depicts two partial female\nfigures floating alongside a flower, a bird, and a silhou-\nette of trees that resembles a cluster of people. Homage\nto My Young Black Sisters (1968), a wooden sculpture of\nan abstracted woman raising her fist, by Catlett, signaled\nthe historic ties of figurative Black art to the Black Power\nmovement and connected the different generations of\nartists on view. Also included were Browne's paintings\nUntitled (Man in Mountain) (plate 2) and For You, both\nfrom 1974, and both featuring a hazy figure reminiscent\nof those that populate the artist's Little Men series, which\ndepicts male archetypes she encountered in her day-to-\nday life. The figure in Untitled (Man in Mountain) is sur-\nrounded by patterns inspired by her travels to Africa.\n\nThrough thelively conversation between the diverse\nartworks on the walls, as well as the spirited exchanges\nthat took place among the large crowd that attended\nthe opening, JAM charted new territory, offering artists\nof color a space where their work was not confined by\na single definition, true to the idea of a \u201ccombination of\nparts or elements.\u201d \u2014LRT\n\n1975\n\n175-76 Sunshine Circle Preschool\n\nAgroup of mothers hung out at JAMwith theirchildrenon\nSaturday mornings.

This enterprise illustrated how JAM func-\ntioned as a nexus of mutual support for Black creatives\nofall types.

Grease, oil, rub, shine. The bane of\n\nall derker Americans was to appear \u201cashy\u201d - that is, to have visible evidence\n\nof the scaly dryness thet accompanies any situation where the skin is exposed to\n\u201cthe elements for any length of time. Since this condition was more visibly\n\nevident on their bodies, Black Americans sought to avoid being seen in this\n\nState in public. Daily, as thousands of school children left their homes,\n\nthey were inspected by their mothers to make sure they were neat, and !\n@reased. Grease was also an important component of the hair straightening\n\nprocess. It served as a protective shield for the hair shaft against the\n\nTaveges of the hot comb, and served also as the catalyst that resulted\n\nin the end-product-straight, swinging, shining hair, a home-grown version of\n\nthe Breck Girl, Long and Silky, etc., etc. of white america. Crinkled hair\n\njust didn't carry the shine like straightened hair!\n\nBut grease and oil, while they were important components in the Black American's\nlife, it was elso his \u201cbadge of shame\u201d. The worse sin that this same school child\ncould commit was to get grease on his homework. It would then be out there. for\n\nall to see - a spot revealing the nitty-gritty of attempting to conform to the\nshining, sparkling American Ideal. It also smacked of the worse kind of ethnicity -\nit wes about fried chicken, barbeque, fat back, etc., etc., and that was ever\n\nsooo country.\n\nDAVID HAMMONS, in his latest exhibition, GREASY BAGS AND BARBEQUE BONES, at\nJUST ABOVE MIDTOWN GALLERY takes this obsession with grease, and raises it to\n\na level of visual consciousness within the Black experience. Using barbeque bones\nend bags with greasy stains, Hammons in the tradition of the dada \u201cfoun\u00e9 object\u201d,\nand surrealist juxtaposition forces us to look at the refuse of our experience, ~\nand see the pecular aesthetic potentialities: patterns that grease: makes, the\nspecial way that grease reacts with porous brown paper. He moves from the \u201cfound\u201d\npatterns to creating his own in a manner similar to the technique of staining\nCenves with diluted pigments, thereby achieving blotted markings and free-form\nShapes. The multiplicity of forms makes direct reference to mass production, the\nSuper--super market, shopping bags...shopping bags which have doubled as suitcases,\nGerbage bags; bags into which Blacks have put cotton balls; cotton balls which\nresemble balls of cut pre-straightened, pre-processed kinky hair, which is encased\nin stocking caps to keep the \u201c'cess\u201d.in place...Cotton Club! Sparkle! Glitter!\nEllington and Beker! Shine, shine on} The entire excercise is carried to another\npertinent sociological plane as the viewer is confronted with the bags, which a\nProudly proclaim on the bottom edge: \u201cWe are ecology minded. This bag will self-\ndestruct in Mother Earth\u201d. Then Hammons! work also becomes a statement, however\nintentional or inadvertent, about recycling and ecology. i\n\nThis exhibition continues Hammons!\u2019 more familiar grease projects, the Body Print,\n\n\u00ae process of oiling the body, and then printing it on paper with baby powder, and\npowdered Pignents, dealing again with the imprint of grease on paper, and its\nrelationship particularly with the Black body. In conjunction with his New York\nexhibition, JUS? ABOVE MIDTOWN GALLERY is sponsoring a \u201cBody Print-In\" on Monday,\nMay 19, 1975. The impulse, as explained by gallery director and owner, Linda Bryant,\n\n: eae the public in the creation of a work of art from their own physical\n\na A viewing of the reality that Hammons presents to'us is essential, even if only\n\nto satisfy your curiosit: ; : . ; ;\n4 y.

Instead, he would pre-\nmiere new work made by staining shopping bags with\nvegetable oil and pork grease, as well as sculptures in\nwhich kinky black hair was affixed to wire in ornamental\npatterns. At the exhibition's opening, several painters\nwere outraged by what they saw as Hammons\u2019s icon-\noclastic materials\u2014sourced from Black barbershops\nand supermarkets rather than an art supply store\u2014and\na spirited debate about their artistic validity ensued.\u201d\nCritique and love lived in the same space at JAM\u2014both\noften sparked by Hammons'\u2018s example.\n\nIn an essay intended for distribution at the exhibi-\ntion, titled \u201cIn the Land of Dixie Peach,\u201d Metropolitan\nMuseum curator Lowery Stokes Sims compared the\nbrown paper bags to the Color Field paintings made in\nNew York during the 1950s and \u201860s.

There were\nlinks to earlier moments in modernism as well. The fan-\nning cascade of grease-stained bags that makes up\nBag Lady in Flight (1975), for example, echoed Marcel\nDuchamp\u2019s Nude Descending a Staircase (No.2) (1912).\nLike Duchamp, Hammons attempted to depict motion\nin astill picture, but he transposed the visual flow onto\nan allegorical female figure walking down a South Los\nAngeles street. While Hammons\u2018s works referenced\nthe cosmos of high art, they were also resolutely earth-\nbound. Across the bottom of Bag Lady is a warning,\nprinted by the supermarket chain from which Hammons\nsourced the bag: \u201cWe are ecology minded. This bag will\nself-destruct in Mother Earth!\u201d\n\nGoode Bryant satisfied her desire for new body\nprints by staging a Print-In during the exhibition run, a\nriff on the sit-ins, teach-ins, and love-ins popular at the\ntime. The event was billed as a \u201cmutually involved . . .\ncommon activity,\u201d an opportunity for participants to\ncreate\u2014with Hammons\u2019s assistance\u2014their own prints,\u201d\nwhich might serve as gifts for loved ones in a period of\n\u201crecession, depression, and general lack of no money in\nthe pocket.\"*) \u2014TJL\n\noppostTe LSSims [Lowery Stoke:\nSims], \u201cIn tho Land of Dixie\nPeach.\u201d Text written for\nDavid Hammons's exhibition\nBags and Barbeque\n1975\n\nLEFT, ToP Aho sorToN Invitation\n(recto and verso) to David\n\nHammons\"s exhibition Greasy\nBags and Barbeque Bones, 197\n\nBELOW David Hammons (left)\nand Suzette Wright (center)\nat the Body Print-In held in\n\nconjunction with Hamnons\u2019s\nexhibition Greasy Bags and\nBarbeque Bon\n\nYenawine\u2019s home, 1975.\nPhotograph by Jeff Morgan\n\npp. 34-35 Body Print-In held\nin conjunction with David\nHammons's exhibition Greasy\nBags and Barbeque Bor\n\nPhilip Yenowine's hou:\nPhotograph by Jeff Morgan\n\n9.

This\nwas exemplified by Suzanne Jackson's Gallery 32, a self-\nfunded arts space in Los Angeles that operated from\n1968 to 1970. A predecessor to Just Above Midtown,\nit was inspired by the vision of artist Charles White\u2014\nwith whom Jackson studied at Otis Art Institute (now\nOtis College of Art and Design)\u2014who believed that art\ncould catalyze activism and social progress.\u201d Jackson's\ndrawing Talk (1976; plate 17), included in the JAM exhi-\nbition, can be interpreted as a visualization of the type\n\u2018of exchange she fostered; its two abstracted figures\nappear face to face, their interior and exterior selves\nfluid, their bodies merging with each other and the\nlandscape. \u2014LR\n\n&\n\n:\n\n2 Back From Wechington\n\n1977\n\nNoah Jemison\n\nJan 4\nvan 2s- David Lampson\n\nFeb 42 Recent Photographs\nFeb is- Palmer Hayden\n\nNar 6\n\nThe Many Facets of Palmer Hayden\n\nAs the only nonliving artist on JAM\u2019s roster, Palmer\nHayden was an outlier, yet his work fit squarely with\nthe gallery's interest in exploring the complexities of\nBlack representation. Though Hayden's paintings were\ncontroversial throughout his career, which began in\nthe mid-1920s, for what some critics perceived as his\ncaricature of his Black subjects, his approach to ste-\nreotypes was not straightforward. His watercolor Just\nBack from Washington (1938; see below), which was\nincluded in The Many Facets of Palmer Hayden, is a case\nin point. It pictures a dapper Black man\u2014presumably\njust back from Washington, DC, standing proud with a\nsmile on his face and a cigar in his mouth\u2014having his\nshoes shined by another Black man.

Pindell\u2019s obsession with the circle\ncame from a desire to give it anew meaning.\n\nIn 1977, circles\u2014thousands of them\u2014appeared\nacross the thirteen abstract paintings and drawings in\nPindell\u2019s solo exhibition at JAM, Recent Works with Paper\nand Video Drawings. The show, which also featured\nthirteen of the artist's \u201cvideo drawings\u201d (photographs\nof drawings onacetate laid on top ofa television screen),\nevinced her fascination with not only circles but lines,\ngrids, arrows, and numbers, all of which she admired\nfor their form as well as their ability to calculate value or\nto identify.** At the time of the show, Pindell was work-\ning as a curator at MoMA, where, as one of few Black\nstaff members, she developed an acute awareness of\nthe ways in which institutions uphold racism and sex-\nism2* Her approach to art making was meditative and\nmethodical, and offered a therapeutic way to process\nthe events of her day-to-day life. In her free time she\nturned to her \u201cbags of holes,\u201d** the chads she had\npunched out of painted manila folders and cardstock.\nIn some works, she methodically inscribed numbers on\nindividual circles and carefully adhered them in a grid-\nlike pattern. To make the works included in this show,\nPindell used spray adhesive and paint to build up the\nsurface of paper with layers of confetti-like chads and\ncolorful glitter, in a process that combined automatism\nand ritual. The resulting works are lyrical, meditative,\nand vibrant, unconfined by their flat supports and their\nfour edges, as well as by the categories of geometry,\nabstraction, craft, and fine art. \u2014yK\n\nBeLow Invitation (recto:\nverso) to Senga Nengudi*\nexhibition R.S.V.P., 193\n\n28.

In the\nyears immediately preceding JAM\u2019s opening, Goode\nBryant had worked at a variety of art museums, includ-\ning the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she had\nheld an education fellowship paid for by the Rockefeller\nFoundation. The program, which was funded for three\nyears, aimed to train \u201cthe new breed of museum staff\nmembers, the socially concerned art historian or cura-\ntor, and the art-wise social worker,\u201d with an eye to \u201chir-\ning minorities.\u201d? But midway through its funding cycle,\na program officer at the foundation already expressed\nconcerns about its efficacy, writing, \u201cOne fellow appar-\nently has no desire to work in a museum at all!\u201d\n\nThe fellows had their own reservations. One\nrecalled that they got people with defined personalities\nand then expected you to sit there and do what you were\ntold (fanet Olivia Henry). Instead, Goode Bryant left\nthe program, which was intended to last a year, four\nmonths in for a job as Education Coordinator at The\nStudio Museum in Harlem, a position she still held\nwhen she started JAM. Then as now, she wanted \u201cto\ncreate an infrastructure with real-life consequences,\u201d*\nnear but outside the museum, able to better respond to\nthe needs of the time.\n\nThe needs of artists and artistic communities in\nJAM\u2019s moment echo in our own. Consider a few exam-\nples of the types of headlines that have appeared in\nthe art and popular press since 2020: \u201cA New Gallery\nOpens with an All-Black Staff,\u201d \u201cThe Swift, Incredible\nRise of a Singular Black Artist,\u201d \u201cA New Vanguard.\n\nIs Reshaping the Art World.\u201d? Uncannily, these recent\nstories, which implicitly equate the rising interest in\nblack art with structural change, might have been\nwritten about the circle of friends and volunteers that\nmade up JAM, which in its time struggled to get press.\nIn a present often imagined as existing without viable\nalternatives, JAM offers one in which indebtedness,\nspirit, and motherhood\u2014value systems not historically\nprioritized by institutions like MoMA\u2014provide ways\nof acknowledging that we need one another, as well as\nmodels for turning entanglement into creativity.\n\nJAM?\u2019s formation as a gallery was a means to an\nend. That end was also an impossibility: the total reor-\nganization of art\u2019s infrastructure. JAM did not envision\ncreating an all-black artistic program. Its disbelief\nin stylistic coherence created an openness to who and\nwhat could find protection under an idea of black art.\n\nIt also aimed to create a sense of possibility for artists\nand a belief that anyone could become a maker.*\nBut its business model\u2014which relied on being in the\nred\u2014did not pretend to offer a viable avenue for\nself-reliance, that hallmark of black excellence. Instead,\n\nit asked how a place for assembly might offer artists\nthe chance to try things that they might otherwise\ndeem too costly\u2014told by others (or themselves) that\nthey shouldn\u2019t take the risk. Could this space incite a\nwide-eyed not-knowing, curiosity, and searching with\nothers? Could that intimacy then be felt in the stuff\n\nof everyday life, or be folded into fantasy and desire?\nUnexpectedly, art produced without institutional man-\ndates (explicitly demanded or otherwise internalized)\nemerged from the heart of New York\u2019s blue-chip com-\nmercial gallery district. This is a black and American\nstory as much as it is a testament to the extraordinary\ndrive of Linda Goode Bryant, the gallery\u2019s founder and\ndirector, and her ability to cannily make good on the\nopportunities at her disposal.\n\nIn using what was available to get what it needed,\nJAM was dependent on its environment.\u2019 One index\nof its resourcefulness can be gleaned from the mate-\nrials of the artworks shown at the gallery: socks, lint,\nhair, rocks, ribbons, nylon, sand, paper bags. Reusing\ndiscarded or fungible matter, JAM artists evinced\nan enterprising sensibility that was matched by the\nknow-how of the people who worked and volunteered\nat JAM. In addition to holding day jobs at a variety of\nother cultural institutions, they were animated by what\nKellie Jones calls \u201cthe energies of Black feminism\u201d in\nher essay in this volume.\u00ae My essay was written in rec-\nognition of JAM\u2019s staff, volunteers, and friends (fig. 1);\ntheir voices form its narrative meter.\u2019 Their quotes,\nexcerpted from oral histories conducted especially\nfor this project, are italicized.

The interest in\nblack signifiers like chicken bones or Thunderbird bot-\ntles skewered the two-sided debate between represen-\ntation and abstraction\u2014and unintentionally ushered\nin the increasing presence of non-black artists. This\nopenness began with Statements Known and Statements\nNew (1976) (see Chronology, p. 36), which featured\nneo-Dadaists Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns\nand other white artists alongside artists of color\nunder the influence of Marcel Duchamp, including\nHammons and Jorge Luis Rodriguez. When the gallery\nmoved to Franklin Street, Asian, Native American,\nLatinx, and white women artists increasingly found\ncover at JAM.\n\nIn retrospect, we can see how JAM\u2019s inclusion\nof non-black artists offered a model of desegregation\nin contradistinction to integration. In 1985, James\nBaldwin read the latter for filth, writing, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\nI want to be integrated into a burning house. Americans\ndecided that desegregation meant integration, and,\nwith this one word, smashed every black institution\nin this country.\u201d A generation after the civil rights\nmovement, Baldwin joined a chorus of black feminist\nthinkers who likewise demonstrated integration\u2019s toll\non black kinship structures through the incorporation\nof education, housing, and childcare into white cul-\ntural norms, rather than the dismantling of inequitable\nvalue systems or resourcing their black counterparts.!\u00a2\nAs the recently deceased bell hooks wrote, \u201cThat shift\nfrom beloved, all-black schools to white schools...\ntaught me the difference between education as the\npractice of freedom and education that merely strives\nto reinforce domination.\u201d\"\u201d\n\nIn the throes of integration, JAM stayed true to\na version of desegregation buoyed by its cooperative\napproach. This was evidenced in public programs\ngeared to families and children, including the Saturday\nMom\u2019s Group and the Sunshine Circle Preschool\n(see Chronology, p. 29), as well as its programmatic\nemphasis on collaboration. As early as 1976, Goode\nBryant imagined the gallery's Fifty-Seventh Street\n\nbuilding as a \u201cco-operative building concept\u201d in\nwhich some thirty-six galleries would coordinate joint\nadvertising through a map of the block and monthly\nnewsletters.'* Her idea for a \u201cvertical museum\u201d'\u00ae did\nnot materialize, but that did not stop Goode Bryant\nfrom attempting other forms of collaboration when\nthe gallery moved to Tribeca. The performance Blind\nDates (1982) (see Chronology, p. 104), for example,\nresulted from three artists working in different disci-\nplines coming together, And JAM\u2019s second exhibition\ndowntown, Dialogues (1980) (see Chronology, p. 89),\nwas organized in partnership with its new alterna-\ntive-art-space neighbors in response to the increase\nin exhibitions organized around identarian affinity.\nThrough this program, JAM welcomed in both artists\nand their communities, including those associated\nwith Interart, Franklin Furnace, the American Indian\nCommunity House, and Basement Workshop. At a\ntime when feminist artists and artists of color worked\nas both presenters and organizers, JAM joined its peers\nin gambling on feminist and multicultural collectivity\nas a value for a desegregated artworld.\n\nCreative entanglements at JAM were so intense\nthat it is sometimes hard to distinguish one maker\nfrom another. To give just one example, that authorial\nblur occurred when Noah Jemison and David Hammons\ndressed up Marquita Pool-Eckert, who was positioned\ninside Jorge Luis Rodriguez\u2019s Circulo con cuatro esquinas\n(Circle with Four Corners) (1976), installed in his JAM\nexhibition Circulos, and lit a candle in front of her\n(fig. 2).?\u00b0This kind of enmeshment and interpersonal\nweave can also happen when you play music together,\nor turn off the lights.\n\nindebt/dn'det/vt\n\nto place (as oneself) under an obligation\n(as of returning something borrowed)**\n\nA 1975 document titled \u201cOutstanding Operating\nAccounts\u201d in a box of JAM\u2019s financial records reads:\n\nAccounts needing immediate attention:\n\nTelephone 197.88\nRent 816.26\nSecurity 200.00\n\nA summary of past due, delinquent, and final notices,\nthe balance sheet also includes a series of relatively\nsmall amounts: $12.96 for an ad in the New York Times,\n$9.10 for postage. The individual notices that Goode\nBryant kept in the same box tell a more affecting nar-\nrative. One invoice from a photocopier who made in-\nvitations for the gallery reads, \u201cWe did this job for you\nin good faith. Don\u2019t you think we deserve the same\n\n14.

As I parsed JAM\u2019s records, I was\nfilled with both a sense of mounting anxiety and reso-\nlute intention amid the chaos. But the balance sheet\u2019s\nformalizing of the cascade of notices was of little use.\nTt wasn\u2019t long before the Civil Court of New York\nbegan issuing eviction notices to the gallery. Within a\nfew weeks of signing the first lease, JAM had stopped\n\npaying its rent. Our landlord would call all the time. The\nphone would ring, and I would be like, \u201cI bet that\u2019s Bill\nFudson.

Unsigned, the original installation belonged\nto all those who might come upon it and wonder.\nSpirit is another way of describing a means of carrying\noff with the signs of authorship.\n\nWhen Hammons and other artists were turning\nto spiritual practices in the 1970s and 80s, they were\ndoing so in the context of a wave of Afro-diasporic\ncontact. Thompson\u2019s scholarship on Yoruba expressive\nculture in present-day Nigeria and across the Americas\nbegan to circulate during JAM\u2019s early years and\ninformed the work of many of the artists who showed\nthere. This was not only an academic exercise for JAM\nartists, many of whom were exposed to Afro-Caribbean\nceremonies in New York through artist Charles Abramson\nand others. These specific crossroads were buttressed\n", "68": "A HAPPY WOMAN\n\nA193 /$d\n\nFIG. 5\n\nby post-independence opportunities for exposure\n\nto West African culture through transnational festivals\nand art historical conferences. There were also the social\nevents at JAM, including Candida Alvarez and Dawoud\nBey\u2019s wedding ceremony, modeled on a Yoruba marriage\nceremony with dancers and drumming.\n\nThe recourse to spirit also emerged from local\nneeds and conditions. Nengudi made Air Propo at a\ntime when there were so many people dying in New York\n(Senga Nengudi). We were in the middle of it. I remember\nwatching people walk through Tribeca one day, and the\nnext they just suddenly weren\u2019t (Tony Whitfield). While\nNengudi and Whitfield described the precariousness\nfor queer people during the AIDS crisis, prema-\nture death was a condition for many. Too many of the\nblack men who showed at JAM died young (Kathleen\nGoncharov): Charles Abramson at forty-three in 1988,\nGeorge Mingo at forty-six in 1996.\n\nIs caring for and about art synonymous with pre-\nparing to keep the dead close?** Just Above Midtown:\nChanging Spaces is a rickety reenactment, an exhibition\nabout what happened between nearly 150 exhibitions.\nItis not an attempt to re-create installations with\nexactitude, but rather to give observable shape to the\nconditions that formed JAM and are still present today,\nand, in the process, to make this history available for\nothers to reconstruct for themselves. How might the\nact of recontextualizing the gallery at MoMA reveal\nsomething in the air, unsaid but everywhere present? If\nyou take for granted the queer, romantic idea that life\nis an artwork, JAM can be approached as a durational\nconceptual work of art, imagined and materialized,\nincomplete and coming into focus. Another yersion of\nour show could have involved leaving the gallery walls\nblank apart from the titles of JAM\u2019s group exhibitions\nand publications\u2014In Recognition, Contextures, The Process\n\nas Art\u2014as prompts for visitors\u2019 collective responses.\nBut before we could create a new public, we had to\ntake account of JAM\u2019s publics through the relationships\nforged, fought for, and (mostly) kept up.\u201d\n\nStories of relationships can be gleaned from\npictures, enacted by works of art, and dramatized by\narchival materials. Together, they testify to the vivac-\nity and livelihoods that Goode Bryant and the gallery\nmade possible, In a note from 1977, Nengudi wrote,\n\u201cLinda I\u2019m so glad we have a new base for the strug-\ngle. Your perseverance is paying off. Take care... and\nif there is anything I could do for you out here let me\nknow. Thanks for being born.\u201d At the top of a 1980\nletter artist Sandra Payne sent to Goode Bryant, she\nincluded a photograph of herself captioned, \u201cA Happy\nWoman\u201d (fig. 5). Below it, she wrote, \u201cDear Linda, I\njust received a letter with an enclosed check.

Framed on the\nwall like the works of art they are, these memory aides\ngive flesh to the relations between people who hung\nout at JAM. When we asked AC Hudgins how we\nmight re-create the gallery as a character, he suggested,\nBuy some cheap wine, get some herb, play some music.\nYears ago, David Hammons proposed an even simpler\ngesture: \u201cLinda never paid the electric bills; just turn\noff the lights.\u201d ** Playing music and playing in the dark\nare also elegiac ways of summoning those who have\ngone before, too many of whom have transitioned\nduring the life of this exhibition\u2019s preparation.

(She subsequently\nrented the individual units to small art businesses and\nfor artist studios, illegally according to the IRS, which\nwould bring a complaint against her before she was\nevicted for the third and last time.) In adapting each\nspace to her aesthetic needs, Goode Bryant was not\nsimply forecasting the winds of gentrification. Through\nLinda, one had a great sense of the vagaries of real estate\nvalue at different times. That was part of the performance of\nJAM\u2014Pplaying the real estate game (Lowery Stokes Sims).\n\n\u2018Unable to purchase any of the buildings in which\nit made its home, JAM made debt the ground zero of\nits business model. Rather than title, it ran on bank\nand personal loans, credit cards, and presales of art-\nworks and books, some of which never materialized.\nGoode Bryant deferred payments on operational costs\nlike heat, electricity, and phone bills by negotiating\nwith bill collectors and taking out new credit cards,\ngladly welcoming her ability to pay the interest without\npaying down the principal. (Ironically, Goode Bryant\nalso used the gallery\u2019s status to confer credit worthi-\nness on artists the gallery showed, as when she wrote\na letter of support for Senga Nengudi\u2019s application\nto American Express.) A similar principle of defer-\nral operated for staff members when the gallery first\nopened. W\u00e9 weren\u2019t paid a set amount. You'd get to the\nweekend, and I remember thinking, \u201cI need to get paid.\u201d\nTf you got paid, it might be one hundred dollars. It would\nbe like an as-needed thing (Pat Cummings). Others have\ndescribed the remuneration during those years in\nstarker terms: She never paid any of us....We kind of\naid her (Horace Brockington).\n\nModels for raising capital varied over the gallery\u2019s\ntwelve-year existence. Before JAM opened, Goode\nBryant received a one-time influx of two thousand\ndollars cash from her parents, Floyd and Josephine\nGoode, who would continue to give the gallery loans\nin times of emergency, In a solicitation letter to other\nfamily members, Goode Bryant offered them gradu-\nated returns on their investment; without the means\nto finance the operation, none of them bought in. The\ngallery sold art, catalogues, and slides, but sales were\nonly ever a partial source of earned income. Artist and\ncreative friends offered personal loans and gifts, the\n\u2018two sometimes indistinguishable. After the organiza-\ntion applied for and was awarded nonprofit status in\n\n1975, it qualified for government support.\u00ae* It could\nalso receive funding from foundations, including the\nsame Rockefeller Foundation that had financed Goode\nBryant's fellowship at the Met. In a letter Petition-\n\ning the foundation\u2019s program officer, Goode Bryant\nwrote, \u201cIt is miraculous that this gallery can still open\nthe doors and provide exhibitions to the public, This\nperiod has been a lengthy and exhausting one, For\n\nall concerned can see the accomplishments that were\nachieved with a budget of zero,\u201d\n\nThe gallery held event-based fundraisers and\nsold memberships, which it advertised as emphasizing\n\u201can interplay between you and the artists.\u201d2\u201d Goode\nBryant was also able to secure corporate grants from\nCBS, arts funders Exxon and Mobil Oil, and Con\nEdison, although the gallery was often late on its utility\npayments to the company. Perhaps the most mean-\ningful form of investment was volunteerism: quiches\nprepared by Faythe Weaver for Brunch with JAM (see\nChronology, p. 36), supplies provided to build out the\nspaces, childcare for Goode Bryant\u2019s two young kids.\nMost of what today\u2019s nonprofits classify as donations\nwent undocumented in the gallery\u2019s financial records,\nas is usually the case for forms of debt that neither\nparty expects to be repaid.\n\nThe threat of debt is no stranger to folks of color.\nThe history of lending as a means of dispossession\nin the Americas extends from unconstrained mortgage\nforeclosures on Indigenous land during the English\ncolonial period and the \u201cexternal debt\u201d imposed on\nHaiti by France and later the United States as ransom\nafter the defeat of slavery and colonialism;7* to\nNew York City\u2019s 1975 debt crisis, which was partially\ncaused by the decrease in tax revenue due to white\nflight, and which eventually led to the firing of\nthousands of public workers, the majority of whom\nwere people of color; to the 2008 subprime mortgage\ncrisis, which was triggered by, among other things,\nblack and Latinx home buyers being lent money at\nexorbitant interest rates precisely because they would\nnot be able to pay it back.*\u00b0 Anthropologist David\nGraeber has argued that while forms of obligation\nhave always structured economic relations, the advent\nof money made them quantifiable through debt\u2014an\nasymmetrical relationship in which creditors are able\nto prey on those with less power, including those seek-\ning home ownership without claims of land and title.\"\nInsidiously, the false promise of rootedness became\nthe tether to indebtedness.\n\nJAM embraced debt\u2014both as an economic\nnecessity and as a value. In The Undercommons, Stefano\nHarney and Fred Moten offer a new valuation of this\ndenigrated term: \u201cCredit only runs one way. Debt is\nmutual.\u201d??Indebtedness\u2014not to a financial institution\nbut to friends, colleagues, and family members\u2014\nnecessitated ongoing commitments and relationships\nbuilt on reciprocity and duration.\u00bb? This kind of\nindebtedness explains why volunteers worked at the\ngallery in its early years in exchange for having a base\nfor the struggle they would wage at their day jobs. This\nkind of indebtedness clarifies how the gallery could\nestablish a market for an artist like David Hammons,\nwho would then sell a benefit print that would keep the\ngallery going.

I hold on to it here to more accurately delin-\neate the historical financial conditions and models\nthat\u2014like other circumscribed protocols (real estate\nspeculation, the commercial gallery model, a promotion\nservice involving multiple outlets across the world) \u2014\nGoode Bryant reformatted, Just as some of the artists\nwho showed at JAM reworked lint, hair, or nylon in\ntheir artworks, Goode Bryant marshaled debt toward a\ndifferent end than the one set out by her creditors.\n\nWhat were the other options available to JAM? The\ncopublishers of this book negotiated their own real estate\ndeals during this same period. The Studio Museum in\nHarlem (founded in 1968) was gifted a building in 1979\nby the New York Bank for Savings, and in 1985 it leased\nthe adjacent vacant lot from the City of New York;\nthe museum is currently constructing its new home on\nthis site.** In the mid-1970s, MoMA representatives\nproposed and then lobbied New York\u2019s State legislature\nto create the Trust for Cultural Resources. This public-\nbenefit corporation, still in existence, blueprinted an\nintricate financial model for cultural institutions in New\nYork City, clearing the way for MoMA to sell the air\nrights above its Fifty-Third Street building and subse-\nquently to develop a residential tower. The Trust enabled\nsome of the proceeds of this new tower to go to MoMA,\nhelping to capitalize its expansion. The Trust also facil-\nitated the exception of taxes on bonds issued to the\nMuseum, a method of debt retirement. When MoMA\nannounced these ambitions, New York City\u2019s mayor,\nAbraham Beame\u2014who himself had just barely avoided\ndefaulting on the city\u2019s debts\u2014celebrated the private-\npublic partnership as a \u201cself-help project\u201d that was\n\u201cgood news for all New Yorkers.\u201d**\n\nIn contrasting these differences in resource allo-\ncation, I am not suggesting that there is a zero-sum\nrelationship between MoMA\u2019s guaranteed forgiveness\nand JAM\u2019s unpaid debts. Rather, I juxtapose them\nto better understand their historical entanglements,\nwhich function as an index of the interconnectedness\nof financial and cultural value in the United States,\nparticularly when it comes to the things black people\nmake and the places we stay. Could we, following phi-\nlosopher and artist Denise Ferreira da Silva, describe\nJAM\u2019s debt as unpayable\u2014an obligation that is not the\ndebtor\u2019s to pay?>\u201d\n\nIn her interview with Thelma Golden in this book,\nGoode Bryant asks, \u201cCan JAM be JAM at MoMA?\u201d*\n\u2018Why do the two institutions at once refuse and need\none another? That this show is happening at MoMA\nis an acknowledgment that JAM, both then and now,\nrequired a Midtown to be just above: a norm to define\nitself against, a set of resources made available by\ndesegregation to siphon off toward more equitable\nends. The debt of our moment to JAM is unpayable\nbecause there is no way to fully acknowledge the\n\nhistory the gallery made possible, nor the models\nfor artistic support it continues to actualize through\nongoing relationships. This exhibition may function as\nan expanded credit, a dedication, and a resource guide.\nBut even an attempt at a reference list\u2014of works made\nby artists supported by the gallery that are now in\nMoMaA\u2019s collection, for example\u2014would fail to grasp\nthe unbridled sense of opportunity JAM offered black\nartists to try some shit out, and, importantly, to fail.\nThe logic of speculation can\u2019t grasp what happens in a\nspace for blackness unconcerned with canon formation\nor the constant policing of the borders of worthiness.\n\u2018What kind of future was made possible when JAM.\ndid not capitalize in the ways other cultural institu-\ntions did? Just as the Studio Museum and MoMA.\nexist today in forms built upon their earlier selves,\nmight we imagine JAM\u2019s existence in the present as\ncommensurate with the resources and accompanying\nvalue systems at its disposal? This is not simply an\nassessment of the racial wealth gap, but an observa-\ntion of an aesthetic still at work. JAM\u2019s itinerant and\nshifting shape is at once a function of the economics\nthat prompted its landlords to evict it from every space\nit occupied and an expression of the kind of prosperity\nit alchemized from that reality.\n\nspirit/spir-ot/vt\n1. to infuse with spirit, especially:\nanimate\n2. to carry off usually secretly or\nmysteriously\n\nThe logic of debt is not confined to finance; it is meta-\nphysical too. Like unpaid rent, religion is another zone\nof life where descriptions of mutual obligation take\nextended license. Take, for example, the Mahasanghika\nVinaya, a fifth-century Chinese translation of the ca-\nnonical Buddhist text, which diagrams the relationship\nof the individual to the collective through the language\nof debt:\n\nWhen one person, thanks to another person, takes\nrefuge in the Sangha [assembly], it is not easy for\nthe former to repay the latter. Even if she were to\nserve that person for her entire life . . . even then,\nit would not be easy to repay him.*\n\nAt JAM, like many sites of artistic worship, devotion\nundergirded the infrastructural belief system, pro-\nviding sacrament \u201cto climb back up into air as if to\nburst the throat.\u201d*\u00b0\n\nIn Cheryl Banks-Smith, Lawrence D. \u201cButch\u201d\nMorris, and Senga Nengudi\u2019s collaborative perfor-\nmance Air Propo (1981; p. 66 and plates 55-57) (see\nChronology, p. 91), Nengudi repeatedly inhaled before\n\n35. \u201cThe Studio Museum in Har\nFact Sheet,\u201d The Studio Museurt\nHarlem website, AC Hudgins, wt\nfather, Alvin Hudgins, had previo\nco-owned the building, worked tt\nwhen it was a furniture and liquo\nstore.

Just as Goode Bryant insisted on taking\nmeticulous notes about artist payments, she made sure\nher kids showed up prepared for the world.

When Nengudi\u2019s pendulous R.S.V.P.\nsculptures had their New York premiere at the gallery,\nin 1977 (see Chronology, p. 39), she contextualized\nthe works\u2019 inception in an accompanying artist state-\nment: \u201cAfter giving birth to my own son, I thought of\nblack wet nurses suckling child after child\u2014their own\nas well as others\u2014until their breasts rested on their\nknees, their energies drained.\u201d*> Maternal care does not\nTequire conception or childbirth, and for black women\n\u2018has been both \u201ccoerced and freely given.\u201d**\u201cBlack\nwomen\u2019s labors have not been easy to reckon with\nconceptually,\u201d Saidiya Hartman has observed of the\ndifficulty of grasping black women\u2019s socially reproductive\nlabors through the figure of the striking worker.7A.\ngallery owner who, rather than paying her bills, asked\npeople questions and held space for the labor of care\nis an unlikely figure in certain narratives of revolution.\nBlack women artists and art workers have provided\nthe sustenance and service necessary to reproduce\nthe creative order on which museums like MoMA.\nest, yet they have not been recognized for the work of\ntheir imaginations. Nevertheless, Goode Bryant and\nthose who volunteered at JAM prioritized caring for\nand about a broad community, At a time when \u201cBlack\nnationalism looked like paintings of mothers suckling\ntheir young in pigments of red, black and green,\u201d she\nproposed another aesthetic for affiliation,\n\nThe business of art and the business of mothering\nwere at times blurred. Part of volunteering at FAM was\nbabysitting, picking kids up, dropping her kids off. We all\nRind of hung out at the apartment (Janet Olivia Henry),\n\nGoode Bryant\u2019s Upper West Side home became the\nfirst stop for many artists finding their footing in a new\ncity, and a second location for gallery operations that\nproved more reliable as JAM moved from one place\n\nto another. Linda\u2019s apartment was the place where a lot\nof the proposals were written. Everyone just hung out and\nworked until they got the project done. There were some\nattempts at songwriting, too. There was a woman there\u2014\ntall and thin\u2014who played the piano. The space was like an\nincubator for all kinds of interesting stuff. You could just go\nthere and freely toss out suggestions and try to come up with\nan idea for a project (Faythe Weaver).\n\nAs Goode Bryant\u2019s kids grew up, they contributed\nto the gallery\u2019s livelihood, too. Kenny was seven years\nold but had clearly picked up pointers on selling art. At one\nexhibit, somebody wanted a piece of his artwork but claimed\nhe couldn\u2019t afford Kenny\u2019s price. So Kenny told him he\ncould make installment payments and pick it up once it\nwas paid off (Pat Cummings). Kenneth and Brienin also\nprovided creative inspiration, modeling for JAM staff\nmember Pat Cummings\u2019s first children\u2019s book, Willie\u2019s\nNot the Hugging Kind (1989; fig. 6), the story of a boy\nwho becomes reluctant to show physical affection as\nhe grows into adolescence but learns little by little the\nvalue of physical contact with loved ones.\n\nOver the last four years, Linda has kept me alive\nprofessionally.

In addition,\ncorrectly or not, she has asked me to stand in for an\ninstitution with which, like all institutions, I have an\nambivalent relationship. Linda is not my mother just as\nIam not hers, but there is something about giving those\naround you the means to at once create and disorder\nyour life, to both recognize and misconstrue you, that is\nin the register of the maternal, biological or constructed.\n(This feeling, I am suggesting, goes both ways.)\n\nHow do you bear another without insisting that\nthey be integrated into your model of the world?\nIntergenerational collaboration sometimes is a bridge;\nit can also be a pier from which only the wind reaches\nthe other side. Motherhood\u2014which, like other forms\nof debt, is at once reciprocal and asymmetrical\u2014can\nanimate feelings of anger and resentment. It is also\na critical model that distinguishes the black radical\ntradition and the history of black-led arts institu-\ntions.\u201d Whenever things get tough between the two of\nus, Linda uses metaphors for motherhood: \u201cMaking\nan exhibition together is like making a baby. We\u2019ll be\nconnected forever.\u201d Because I am a performer, I\u2019ve\ncome to call the oscillation that emerges here a duet:\na call followed by another call. Linda has asked, \u201cCan\nJAM be JAM at MoMA?\u201d to which I ask, \u201cIf JAM is\nalready entangled with MoMA, what do you want\ntheir future to hold?\u201d\n\nTo the Present\n\nLorna Simpson\u2019s collage Linda (For Ursula inaugural\nmagazine) (2018; fig. 7) juxtaposes two photographs of\nLinda Goode Bryant taken by Dwight Carter, an early\nJAM supporter, at the time of the gallery\u2019s founding.\nIn this visual stutter crowned by an aquamarine stain,\nSimpson diagrams how the gallery\u2019s work continues\n\nin the present. After closing JAM, in 1986, Goode\nBryant worked in New York City\u2019s budget office before\nbecoming a documentary filmmaker and subsequently\nstarting Project EATS, an urban farming initiative\n(see Goode Bryant biography, p. 175). But there are\nmore structural ways in which JAM\u2019s dispersal continues\nin the art and culture worlds everywhere around us.\nAta time when many institutions are racing to problem-\nsolve their histories of exclusion, JAM provides a model\nnot only of desegregation but also of disintegration:\n\na refusal to conform to the self-perpetuating norms of\ninstitutional life. Goode Bryant and I have been collab-\norating on Just Above Midtown: Changing Spaces since\nthe summer of 2018; it is scheduled to open at The\nMuseum of Modern Art in the fall of 2022. In that in-\nterval, the present has continued to unravel. Covid-19,\nwhich attacks the respiratory system, and the war on\nblack life, which has made \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d a global\n\nFIO. 7\n\nrallying cry, have highlighted our uneven access to air.\nThis world on fire is separated from the one in which\nJAM emerged perhaps only by degrees of intensity.\nThe loss of life from unmanned combat drones in Iraq\nand Afghanistan, extreme weather events, and hyper-\nvisible forms of state violence are continuous with\n\nthe military-industrial complex that spurred the war\nin Vietnam, the aerial spraying of pesticides, and the\ndisruption of black organizations by COINTELPRO.\nResource hoarding, climate apocalypse, and anti-\nblackness continue to be interlocking conditions.\nDespite the real changes that have occurred in the\nintervening years, the same atmosphere persists.\n\nWhat does this account of JAM\u2019s refusal to pay the\nbills and its use of resources like spirit and care make\nperceptible? It\u2019s hard to imagine how art can intervene\nin the climate catastrophe without first sensing that art\nis nature and the environment, the place from which\nmaterials as traditional as pigment or as iconoclastic as\nhair are sourced, as necessary to life as a basket of wild\noats, and the ground to which our processions return\nthe ash and dust of life. Art can\u2019t intervene in the after-\nmath of the extrajudicial murders of black people if\nwe don\u2019t first acknowledge that premature death isn\u2019t\na problem of a /ack of representation in visual culture,\nbut of a hypervisibility circulated through surveillance\ntechnologies that might require the performance of\nsubterfuge. And art can\u2019t address resource hoarding\nif we don\u2019t first recognize that museum collections\noften enclose art in \u201cmusty-dank-but-spotless\u201d environ-\nments, as Goode Bryant recognized at age twenty-three\n\n59.

One night, for example, Venezuelan artist\nRolando Pefia, presented by Cayman Gallery, punctured\nthe bottoms of gold-painted barrels suspended from the\nceiling as part of his performance Crude Oil, letting the\nblack substance of the same name ooze onto the gallery\nfloor. Another evening, Native American performers\nandactors Jane Lind and Maria Antoinette Rodgers, pre-\nsented by American Indian Community House Gallery,\ndanced to live drumming in matching contemporary\npowwow regalia.\n\nThis collective exercise underscored the possibil-\nities of shaping and redefining community within the\nart world, as well the challenges, for even its \u201calterna-\ntive\" sector needed reminding that \u201cwhite avant-garde,\npost-modern art isn't the only underexposed, unrecog-\nnized art,\u201d as the music critic David Jackson argued in\nan unpublished essay written for the show.\u2019 Despite the\nmixed reviews it received, Dialogues achieved its goal:\nitbroke through the fabricated silos of the arts, bringing\ntogether artists, audiences, and institutions that were\ntypically isolated from one another. \u2014LR\n\n\u201cWe find that the survival of our people\nis based on our use of modern forms of\ncommunication. The insurgent messages\nwithin these forms must serve as our\nevocative measures.\u201d\n\n\u2014Edgar Heap of Birds, c. 19831\u00b0\n\nFor the visual-art component of Dialogues, the American\nIndian Community House Gallery showed the work\nof Edgar Heap of Birds. The artist, who belongs to the\nCheyenne and Arapaho nations, created Understanding\nthe Uniqueness of an Ethnic Entity (1980; plate 49),\nwhich consisted of painted die-cut letters adhered\ndirectly to the wall in two columns: Cheyenne words for\nanimals were paired with intentional mistranslations in\nEnglish. Heap of Birds selected the latter from exhibition\ndidactics a museum had recently forced him to write to\nexplain his shift from recognizably \u201cethnic\u201d to more polit-\nically oriented work.\" What initially resembled a bilingual\ndictionary was actually a record of irreconcilable differ-\nence, an insurgent message about the position of the\nIndigenous artist who had to perform their ethnicity for\nan audience that had no knowledge of their culture.\n\nUniquely aware of the power of institutions, Heap of\nBirds envisioned a one-person exhibition of his own work,\ntitled Sharp Rocks, that would travel from one alterna-\ntive art space to another, including Just Above Midtown,\nin 1984. In his proposal, he framed his paintings, instal-\nlations, and videos as modern equivalents to the Native\nAmerican arrow point, a traditional tool for self-defense\nand preservation.\u201d With Sharp Rocks, which was eventu-\nally realized (though not at JAM), Heap of Birds applied his\nStrategic use of language to exhibition making, extend-\ning his means of achieving self-authorship.?, \u2014EB\n\n9.

For this show, Which Was her\nfirst solo exhibition, Maren Hassinger created Beach, a\nroom-size installation.\" Composed of wooden dowels\nanchored in mounds of painted plaster and sand, the\nwork appeared to dance across the floor despite being\nfirmly rooted. Sprouting at various angles, the reed-\nlike forms all flowed in the same direction, as If a strong,\nwind had swept through the gallery. The sculptures\nwere arranged in organic clusters, prompting viewers\nto meander between them in order to experience the\nwork, and the space, in its entirety. As Lorraine O'Grady\nremarked in the exhibition's press release, Beach cap-\ntured \u201cthe polarity of \u2018movement/rest,\u201d\u201d transforming\nthe gallery into a natural refuge.\"*\n\nThis work resembled one that Hassinger had cre-\nated over the summer for Creative Time's Art on the\nBeach 2, an initiative that brought site-specific installa-\ntions and performances to the undeveloped beachfront\nat Battery Park City, in Lower Manhattan. In response to\nthe saplings that she saw blowing in the breeze at this\nlocation, Hassinger planted undulating wire ropes in\nthe sand, tilting them in the direction of the wind. Both\norganic and industrial, Forest gestured simultaneously\ntoward the natural elements of the site and the man-\nmade skyline that rose behind it. Rather than perma-\nnently alter the environment, Hassinger\u2019s temporary\ninstallation was completed by it\u2014reflecting a process\nthat lives at the intersection of dissonant forces, harmo-\nnizing the spaces her work inhabits.\n\nFor Outlaw Aesthetics, the first group show held at\nJAM on Franklin Street, Hassinger created Palmettos\n(1980; plate 46), which consisted of delicate, partially\nunraveled pieces of wire rope resembling palms or dan-\ndelion seeds. Palmettos seemed to drift across the wall;\npropelling itself by the parallelograms of negative space\nbetween each component. With its repetitive uniformity\nandits intrinsic relationship to its environment, the work\nmaintained what Linda Goode Bryant referred to as a\n\u201cbalanced union with space.\u201d\"*\n\nA trained dancer, Hassinger incorporates embed:\nied knowledge into her sculptures as well as her perfor\nmances. Still Wind (1981), which the artist performed at\nNew York\u2019s Stilwende club during a benefit for the JAM\nexhibition Crossovers, unified her practices acrogs dis:\nciplines. Hassinger and her dance partner stretched and\nleaned, moving ina slow rhythm that emulated the \u201cpare:\ndo-kinetic quality\u201d of her wire-rope medium.

In addition to the artists, Hiller and\nLacy engaged two critics, Caryn Faure-Walker and Moira\nRoth, to deliver a series of lectures. The public events, as\nwell as the private gatherings that took place between\nthem, were intended to provide a new context for the\nparticipants\u2019 artworks and to trace the links between\nartists, collectives, and feminist concerns across con-\ntinents\u2014all in an effort to build broader networks for\nwomen artists working in performance.** According\nto the organizers, significant geographic differences\nbetween the artists created fertile ground for debate:\n\u201cThe London group communicates with a heavy reli-\nance on language, while the Los Angeles group empha-\nsizes person-to-person confrontational performance as\nameans of communicating ideas.\u201d** We'll Think of a Title\nAfter We Meet, the program's original title, speaks to its\ncollaborative ethos.\n\nDespite their keen awareness of the ways in which\nwomen had been shut out of art institutions and the art\nhistorical canon, Hiller and Lacy committed their own\nact of exclusion by not including any Black artists in LA/\nLondon Lab, an omission that bolstered the critique that\nmost feminist collectives and movements at the time\nwere not truly inclusive.2* \u2014yK\n\nMar7- Peter Feldstein\n\n\u201car28 Recent Color Photographs p i26\n\nMart4~ Maryam Zafar\n\n\u2018\u2019er\u00e9 Reference Points\nUndercurrents Gallery\n\nmar 3t- An Exhibition of 10 Artists\n\n4pr2 Ed Clark, Adger Cowans, Ray Grist, Jacqui\nHolmes, Bill Hutson, Mohammad Khalil,\nGretchen Long, Tyrone Mitchell, Vincent\nSmith, Luther Van\nSponsored by Malcolm-King Harlem\nCollege Extension and the New York\nUrban Coalition, Inc.\n\n\u2018prs- Vintage All-Black Cast Musicals\n\n\u2018er24 & Murder Mysteries\nFilm series, every Friday in April 1981\n\n4ers- Sweet Sweetback\u2019s Baadasssss Song\n\n4r24  widnight film screening, every\nFriday in April 1981\n\nAprit- Czashka Ross, Mitch Schmidt\n\n\u2018ay2 Wain Gallery\n\ntor as Cynthia Kuebel \u201cMaking\n\nay 2\n\na Spectacle of Herself\u201d\nUndercurrents Gallery\n\n\u201cB\u201d Westerns\n\n\u201cA rootin\u2019 tootin\u2019 wild & wooly western\nround up\u201d\nFilm series, every Friday in May 1981\n\nTurnabout\n\n\u201cArtworks by critics, curators, and arts\nadministrators\u201d\n\nBarbara Jo Ciurej, Jenny Dickson, John\nFreedman, Ken Friedman, Howard Goldstein,\nLawrence Hanson, Marvin Heiferman, Janet\nHeit, Elizabeth Hess, Wopo Holup, David\nJackson, Jan Juracek, Bob Kane, April\nKingsley, Carole Ann Klonerides, Janet\nKoenig, Kay Larson, Ann Lauterbach, Ed\nine, Lucy Lippard, Lindsay Lockman,\nMeredith Lund, Lenore Malen, Jim Melchert,\nRobert Monk, Barbara Novak, Andrea\nPedersen, Barbara Quinn, Ray Ring, Geno\nRodriguez, Moira Roth, Irving Sandler,\nLowery Stokes Sims, Joan Snitzer,\n\nAnn Stubbs, Warren Tanner, Ellen Weider,\nJohn Wessel\n\nMay 9\u2014\nMay 30\n\nPerformances: The Administrators: A Subset\nof Disband (Ingrid Sischy and Martha\nWilson), Peter Frank, John Perreault\nSelected by Tony Barboza, Helene Brandt,\nSusan Dallas-Swann, Jane Dickson, Harriet\nFeigenbaum, Harmony Hammond, Janet Henry,\nBudd Hopkins, Nancy Holt, Patrick Ireland,\nKazuko Miyamoto, Paul Lamarre, Joe Lewis,\nAlgernon Miller, Howardena Pindell, Sal\nRomano, Sandy Skoglund, May Stevens, Boaz\nVaadia, John Woo, Randy Williams, William\nT.

True\nto the gallery's egalitarian spirit, anyone could enroll,\nregardless of education or exhibition history, for spe-\ncific sessions or the program in full, and scholarships\nwere available. Guest speakers\u2014gallerists, artists,\nframers, and leaders of cultural organizations, among\nothers\u2014presented on topics including \u201cHousing and\nWorkspace,\u201d \u201cArtists Rights,\u201d and \u201cThe Art Market:\nPatronage and Collecting.\u201d\n\nThe program continued even when JAM was\nbetween spaces and expanded once the gallery\nreopened in Tribeca. In 1982, seeking to support artist\ncommunities beyond New York City and to generate\nrevenue for the gallery, Goode Bryant outlined a plan\nto produce a box-set video series under the auspices\nof ArT.V., JAM\u2019s new video arm. For collaborators she\nenlisted video artist Dieter Froese as director, Wade\nMiller as production manager, and Cathey Billian as dis-\ntribution manager.** The planned series would replicate\nthe BBA curriculum with videos outlining the practical\nskills, individuals, and institutions involved in making\nand selling contemporary art.\n\nOnly one film was ever made. True to the ethos of the\nprogram, it is both experimental and educational, and\nserves as an overview centered on the question \u201cWhat\nis the business of being an artist?\u201d The footage includes\ninterviews with representatives from a wide swath of the\nartworld: large institutions like MoMA, alternative spaces\nlike JAM, high-end galleries such as Mary Boone, and\nindividual artists\u2019 studios. One scene features a mon-\ntage of VHS boxes labeled \u201cART\u201d stacking up in a freeze-\nframe, one by one, until the boxes fill the screen, as the\nnarrator proclaims, \u201cProduction of multiples is another\nmeans by which artists can distribute their work, Editions\n\nasove Flyer for Cr\nVideo, 1981\n\n", "94": "ATTENTION!1 I\nSPECTRE W OMAN\n\nTAN. 4 \u00a25\u00b0\n1432\n\nSTECTRE WOMAN\nEXHIBIT | INSTALLATION\n\n(\u00a2L UES, SOUNDS, THRILLS, <HILL 5,\nAND ReLICs)\n\nOcTOBER 3 unit\nHALLOWEEN\n\nof artworks ranging from videotapes to graphics to small\npublications are a way for an artist to reach a larger\naudience.\u201d The film then returns to artists, gallerists,\ncurators, and cultural workers discussing the burgeon-\ning art market of the 1980s.

He came up with\nthe name for the gallery, made benefit prints for it, and\nshowed there consistently. Appropriately, in the wood-\nframed assemblages he presented in this solo exhibi-\ntion, he trained his eye on the devices and materials that\n\nhold other objects together\u2014hooks and nails, thread,\nspools, and twine. Having committed to go to the art\nsupply store as little as possible, he instead sourced\nthe building blocks for his work from his immediate sur-\nroundings: the streets of Manhattan, which he has called\nhis \u201ceye level,\u2019?\u201d and the Metropolitan Museum of Art,\nhis employer from 1972 to this day, where he obtained\nslides in particular. Williams's polymorphous, focused\nuse of found objects reflected his reception of both Neo-\nDada and early-twentieth-century African American art,\nwhich he had studied at New York University under Hale\nWoodruff. His work also benefited from the useful tech-\nniques he had learned from family members, including\nhis grandfather, a carpenter, and his mother, a dress\npatternmaker. \u2014TJL\n\nvan 9\u2014\nJan 30\n\nJanet Henry\nRetroactive pp 128-29\nUndercurrents Gallery\n\nJanet Olivia Henry\u2014whose work spans installation,\nsculpture, collage, design, beadwork, and photogra-\nphy\u2014met Linda Goode Bryant while working as a fellow\nat the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a position Goode\nBryant had held previously. Henry would eventually\nwork at JAM, where she served as Goode Bryant's fre-\nquent interlocutor and designed and edited the gal-\nlery\u2019s magazine Black Currant. Henry, who was inspired\nby JAM's spirit of curiosity and experimentation, has\ndescribed the gallery as a place for \u201cartists who just\nwanted to follow their minds.\u201d**\n\nHenry purchased toys, dolls, miniatures, and other\nobjects and materials from mom-and-pop toy stores,\nsecondhand shops, flea markets, and yard sales around\nNew York and arranged her finds in miniature vignettes\ninspired by her own life, exploring personal belongings\u2019\ncapacity for storytelling and symbolism.* Retroactive,\nHenry\u2019s solo exhibition at JAM, included action figures\npositioned in dioramas; dolls, toys, and detritus in clear\nplastic encasings hung on the wall; and juju boxes that\nfunctioned as microcosms of memories and memora-\nbilia. Each object or tableau formed a distinctive piece\nof a larger whole. Treating dolls and figurines as proxies,\nHenry reimagined her world, gesturing toward the intri-\ncacies of a life complicated by the implications of race,\ngender, migration, and occupation while maintaining\nan ethos of play. In the diorama The Studio Visit (1982;\nplate 69), for example, a Black woman artist converses\nwith a white woman curator, the former cocking her\nhead to the side as she watches the latter hold a frame\nto her face. The scene captures the absurdity and the\ndifficulty of engaging with the predominantly white art\nworld as a Black artist. Ritual (1982-83), which features\na Black woman outfitted in a yellow robe and slippers,\nsurrounded by foliage and enjoying a moment of respite,\nemphasizes how important\u2014and rare\u2014it is for Black\nwomen to find space for rest and care. \u2014Yk\n\nBarry Yourgrau and\nChuck Rosenberg\nPoetry reading\n\nvan 14\n\nLert Flyer for Tone Blevins,\nEllen Fisher, and Mary\nSchultz's performance\nSpectre Woman, 1982\n\n36.

But in a nuclear\nwar no one's strength fails until both sides have been\nannihilated.\u201d Some participating artists directly\naddressed the nuclear question. Margia Kramer, for\nexample, showed Still Life with Rad Gloves (198:\nopposite page), a box containing crushed eyeglasses,\na broken watch, and a melted glass Coca-Cola bot-\ntle, all accessible only with the attached radiation-\nattenuating gloves. Like a time capsule found after a\ncatastrophe, the work imagines a scenario in which\nthe artifacts of everyday life have been rendered toxic.\nOther artists referenced the ongoing specter of US\nimperialism, among them Martha Rosler, whose con-\ntribution, a large drawing titled Pie in the Sky and We\nDie (1981-82), shows a wraithlike figure in a cowboy hat\nwatching a bomb descend ona landmass labeled \u201cLatin\nAmerica, USSR, Europe, You + Me.\u201d Still others evoked\nthe terror of modern warfare more generally, as Brigid\nKennedy did in Naked Raid (1981), a trio of eerily feature-\nless aerial bombers made of wire mesh and paper and\nsuspended from the ceiling.\n\nNot all of the works offered such sobering visions.\nDinosaur Project\u2014a collective of twenty artists from\nIthaca, New York\u2014presented Fall Out Fashion, a perfor-\nmance showcasing artist-designed clothing for a post-\napocalyptic world, held on Armed Forces Day to empha-\nsize the connection between militarism and looming\ndisaster.

This was a publication of\nthe San Francisco Video Festival,\n\nlatest communication technologies, dismantling the\ntraditional boundaries of art and affirming the influence\nthat video had on the world.\n\nDaily video screenings, organized thematically, fea-\ntured works that ruptured the medium\u2019s neutral veneer.\nIn The Perfect Leader (1983), for example, Max Almy\ndeftly utilized media techniques to render visible the\n\nKaren Finley and Tony Oursler, was originally shown\nbetween pornographic films at a love hotel. Osterhout\u2019s\nprimary audience was not the art world but \u201cthe people\nin their rooms.\u201d The Motel Tapes, and About TV more\ngenerally, demonstrated the genre-defying capabilities\n\nq\n\n|\n\nof experimental shorts by numerous artists, including |\n|\n\nconstruction of televised authority. A dystopian com-\nputer program cycles through the various characteris-\ntics of an archetypal white male to create \u201cthe perfect\nleader,\u201d a seductive combination of charisma, moral-\nity, and palatable force. As symbols of power and other\nimagery collide, intensified by a fast-paced soundtrack,\nAlmy\u2019s montage reaches a fever pitch, offering a dis-\nturbing performance of televisual manipulation.\nAnother featured work, The Amarillo News Tapes\n(1980), resulted from the San Francisco-based collec-\ntive T. R. Uthco\u2019s artist residency at KVII-TV, a local sta-\ntion in Amarillo, Texas. In one scene, the artists receive\ninstructions from a reporter on their news delivery,\nwhile in another, anchors recite absurdist scripts written\nby the artists. Through satirical subversion, works like\nthe News Tapes called the legitimacy of the media into\nquestion. Elsewhere in the exhibition, Atkins showed\nfootage of CBS News anchor Dan Rather's testimony at\naslander trial against him and his show, 60 Minutes, that\nhad taken place earlier in the year.

Minimal Mystic (1982; plate\n80), for example, pictures a dissipating figure\u2014a long\nexposure of the artist\u2014kneeling in front of a wrinkled\nburlap backdrop. This work belongs to Chong\u2019s I-Traits\nseries (1979-85), which he has described as the \u201cvisual\nutterances of a culturally misplaced shaman, using art\nas a pretext for magic and mysticism.\u201d\u201d The shaman in\nMinimal Mystic, even while vanishing, still conjures the\nspiritual into the setting. \u2014LAT\n\nDecs- Sydney Blum p i134\nJan7\n\nDecs- Joanna Freeman\nJan7\n\nseLow Jerri Allyn perform-\ning Love Novellas, 1983.\nPhotograph by Herb Porr\n\n72, Albert Chong, conversation with\nthe author and Thomas (T.)

Its staff worked out of an office at\n225 Lafayette Street until September, when they relo-\ncated to 503 Broadway.\n\nassi-34 Afro-Pop\n\nIn 1981 Linda Goode Bryant began planning the exhibi-\ntion Afro-American Pop Culture, or Afro-Pop for short.\u2019*\nWith this show, she sought to expand the gallery\u2019s focus\nby presenting Black popular culture's contributions\nacross a variety of realms, including \u201cdance, humor,\nfashion, music, food, environments, performance,\ngames, church, social clubs and oral diaries.\u201d\"* Goode\nBryant wanted to commission new installations by David\nHammons, Senga Nengudi, James Andrew Brown, Randy\nWilliams, Sandra Payne, and Janet Olivia Henry.\u201d* These\nartworks would be shown alongside \u201cartifacts, icons .. .\nand symbols\" such as \u201cstraightening combs and hot curl-\ners, funeral photos and church fans with images of Jesus\nor Martin Luther King .. . step charts for popular dances,\nrare and out-of-print recordings, [and] dream books.\"\u201d\u201d\n\nGoode Bryant's efforts to highlight Black material\nculture in a gallery context intersected with contem-\nPoraneous projects like Group Material\u2019s 1981 exhibi-\ntion People\u2019s Choice: Arroz con Mango, for which the\ncollective invited their primarily Latinx neighbors in the\nEast Village to place objects of personal significance on\ndisplay, thereby recontextualizing them as art. For the\nJAM project, anthropologist John Langston Gwaltney\nwas hired to create an audio installation from interviews\nwith artists and cultural producers on Black culture in the\nUnited States.\u201d There were nearly a dozen performances\nplanned, from Black fraternity and sorority dances to\na multimedia presentation of Black fashion and beauty\nculture. The project\u2019s expanding program led to com-\nmensurate cost increases, and JAM staff sought to find\nvolunteers and in-kind donors. Despite receiving sup-\nport from several private and public sources, the gallery\n\u2018was unable to raise the necessary funds, and planning\nfor the project ceased after spring 1984.\n\nThough it never materialized, Afro-Pop shaped\nJAM's trajectory, bringing new collaborators into the\ngallery's orbit and emphasizing performance as a strat-\negy for exhibiting Black history. Oversight of the exhi-\nbition\u2019s music program was delegated to Greg Tate, a\nyoung music critic. Tate proposed a multipart montage\nof twentieth-century Black popular music, Arranged\nchronologically, the program would have started with\nimprovisations based on popular jazz standards, then\nmoved through Black achievements on the guitar and\nsaxophone, as well as the contributions of gospel, soul,\nscat, and swing. With an eclectic artist list that fea-\ntured both intergenerational Afro-pop icons such as\nAretha Franklin and younger groups such as DC punks\n\nBad Brains, Tate\u2019s multi-genre proposal was a fitting\nexpression of JAM\u2019s vast ambitions and its continued\ncommitment to an expansive idea of Black art. Tate\nwent on to edit the JAM periodical B Culture (see\nChronology, p. 155) and to organize musical perfor-\nmances at the gallery. \u2014BE\n\nLert Sticker created as part\nof the planning for the unre-\n\nalized exhibition Afro-Pop,\n1983\n\nopposite Members of the\n\u2018Sydney\nBlum's residence on Nest\nTwonty-Sixth Street and\nin an unidentified office\n\n74. \"Project Title: Afro-American Pp\nCulture: A Mixed: Medi Eaten? \u2018\n1981, JAM Records, Box 33, \"Alto\nPop General.\u201d In gathering infor=\nmation about Afro-Pop, Thave relied\nprimarily on planning documents,\ncorrespondence, flyers, summary. i\nreports, and other sources located in\n\nthe JAM Records, Box 33, q\n\n75, \"This Spring, Just Above Midtown:\n\n76.

It is characterized by\n\u201corganizational innovation, creative experimentation,\nand attempts to remedy systemic deficiencies,\u201d! in\nestablishments that value the communitarian, collective,\nand anti-elitist. Such spaces eschew standard bureau-\ncratic form, privileging the flexible and adventurous\nand the needs and agency of local artists. They offer\na critique of both commercialism and aesthetics. One\n1960s innovator, Jacki Apple, also describes the art itself\nas different, \u201cprocess-oriented [and] post-Minimal\u201d;\nemerging in a conceptual environment that did not\nvalue the market, \u201cthe work was temporal, ephemeral,\ntransitory, performative, and investigatory: process\ntook precedence over product.\u201d?\n\nThe growth of alternative spaces allowed artists of\ncolor and women artists to make greater inroads into\nthe artworld. One legacy of 1960s and \u201970s activism,\nthese spaces instantiated the model of the artist as citi-\nzen intent on changing the world, in a subtle transition\nfrom known forms of political activism to a politics\nof representation.? However, if cultural diversity was\nvalued in the American art universe, it was, more often\nthan not, seen as part of community connection and\ndevelopment in ethnic neighborhoods, in Harlem,\nQueens, the Bronx, Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant,\nand Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown and Latinx East Village.\nThe venues and organizations located in these parts\nof the city included The Studio Museum in Harlem,\nWeusi-Nyumba Ya Sanaa, El Museo del Barrio,\nFashion Moda, Longwood Arts Center, Jamaica Art\nCenter, Basement Workshop, and Kenkeleba House.\nEven institutions based in the lower Manhattan\ncultural district (Hatch-Billops Collection, American\nIndian Community House Gallery, Acts of Art, and\nCayman Gallery) were considered more culturally\nspecific than alternative and often receive cursory\nattention in written histories, or do not appear at all.\nIgnored by or barred from the art world generally,\nfolks of color played out their desires for an exhibition-\nary complex, their own will to representation, in these\nautochthonous art spaces, which followed from the\nmore informal churches, cultural centers, and business\noffices that had supported and fueled their dreams\nearlier in the century.\n\nLinda Goode Bryant figures prominently in this\nbroader art historical narrative. Her Just Above\nMidtown Gallery (affectionately known as JAM) first\ntook root in New York\u2019s oldest blue-chip art neigh-\nborhood, on Fifty-Seventh Street (1974-79), and\nlater in the emerging downtown districts of Tribeca\n\n(1980-84) and SoHo (1984-86). As Rujeko Hockley\nand Catherine Morris have argued, JAM played a\ncrucial role in 1970s Black avant-garde and experi-\nmental arts, supporting a bevy of Black creators, not\nonly visual artists but musicians and writers. Moving\nbetween for-profit and nonprofit strategies, JAM\nembraced a wide array of organizational methods,\nprofessionalized artists and collectors, and, for all\nintents and purposes, invented the market for the work\nit would show.*\n\nFrom its inception, JAM vexed established modes\nof commerce and representation alike. In the mid-\n1970s most of the longstanding New York art world\nstill did not know what to do with Black artists, outside\nof the few stars; Jacob Lawrence, Romare Bearden,\nand the meteoric Bob Thompson. It was assumed that\nBlack artists were amateurs, outliers, or hobbyists.\nWhile some neighboring gallerists\u2014Terry Dintenfass\n(who showed Lawrence), Betty Parsons, and Sidney\nand Carroll Janis\u2014were supportive, the majority of\nFifty-Seventh Street rejected the investigatory methods\nof JAM\u2019s director and artists as much as their race. In\nthe midst of a recession, Goode Bryant had fearlessly\ntalked her way into renting the space\u2014724 square feet\non the fifth floor\u2014from owner Bill Judson, and she\nand supporters rehabbed the place, putting in parquet\nfloors. Their excitement notwithstanding, JAM\u2019s first\nhome, located in the back of the building and lack-\ning windows, mirrored the cramped spaces that had\nhistorically been available to Black artists in the United\nStates and abroad: the children\u2019s galleries, the foyers\nand hallways, the project rooms, and the smallest gal-\nleries in any museum.>\n\nSome of the earliest documents in the JAM archives\nreveal Goode Bryant\u2019s prescience and point to the\nunwavering vision that would guide her over the twelve\nyears she spent crafting a gallery with national and in-\nternational reach, twinned commercial and educational\nportfolios, and programming that supported a creative\ncommunity and championed multimedia, installation,\nand performative practices.\n\nJAM\u2019s first show, Synthesis (fig. 1) (see Chronology,\np. 29), like the gallery itself (see opposite page), came\nwith a definition: \u201ca combination of parts or elements\ninto a complex whole.\u201d* The exhibition made space\nfor a larger, global Black art world.\u201d The West Coast\n\ndelegation included Dan Concholar, David Hammons,\n\nand RoHo; Alonzo Davis and Suzanne Jackson, who\nwere also gallerists; and Los Angeles native Camille\nBillops, who had already (with her husband, James\n\nV.

This tendency was also evident\nin work by West Coast participants, for example, in\nHammons\u2019s body prints and Concholar\u2019s landscapes.\nGoode Bryant's synthesizing vision made space for an\nexpansive coalition and revealed a broader history of\nAfrican American art practice. The inclusion of lyrical\nabstractions by Norman Lewis paid respect to an ear-\nlier generation of New York-based Black artists, whose\nwork remained underappreciated even as their activist\nspirit persisted.*\n\n50JN}.XO}UO)\n\nFor the gallery\u2019s fourth anniversary, in 1978,\nGoode Bryant produced not only a signature show but\na book that came to define the art of a generation\n(see Chronology, p. 40).\u00b0 In Contextures (fig. 2), she\ntraced the parameters of \u201cContexturalism,\u201d which\nshe saw in the flexible, noncommercial, and for the most\npart nonrepresentational, mixed media, and perfor-\nmative practices of Hammons, Senga Nengudi (fig. 3),\nHouston Conwill, Maren Hassinger, Howardena\nPindell, and others. As theorized by the gallerist, these\nartists used \u201cremains\u201d (inchoate but not completely\nindeterminant matter) whose site, margins, or context\ndefined them as art; engaging the sensate and the sonic\nalong with ritual action, the Contexturalists imbued\n\u201cabstract and conceptual systems with content.\u201d!?\n\nIn the summer of 1979 JAM closed its space on\nFifty-Seventh Street. A year later it reopened in the\nrawer, hipper arts neighborhood of Tribeca with an\namended moniker, Just Above Midtown/Downtown.\nNow with two floors and a significantly larger footprint,\nJAM doubled its number of exhibitions, increased\nworkshops and lectures, and opened its doors to an\never-widening array of practices and the diversity\nthat downtown itself represented. Live projects by\nHassinger, Lorraine O\u2019Grady, Kaylynn Sullivan\n\n\u2018TwoTrees, William Pope (aka Pope.L), Martha Rosler,\nand Linda Montano would become indelibly asso-\nciated with the birth of the alternative-space scene.\nEvents featured musicians such as Steve Reich and\nLawrence D. \u201cButch\u201d Morris (the latter in collabora-\ntion with Nengudi and dancer Cheryl Banks-Smith);\nHammons, dancer Bill T.

JAM presented a solo show of his work in 1982,\nthe same year he and his partner, Jeanette Ingberman,\nstarted their own gallery, Exit Art, on Broadway in\nSoHo. A few years later JAM would move just two\nblocks down the street. In the gallery\u2019s last location,\nGoode Bryant focused on building a laboratory where\nartists could create in real time. Instead of exhibition\nspace, there were areas for artists to think and make\n(and perhaps change the world). For Goode Bryant\nthe curatorial process was no longer memorialized in\nobjects but contained in living possibilities that held\nout \u201can alternative or corrective to the failures of\nmainstream institutions and ideologies.\u201d!\n\nJAM\u2019s story also reflects the energies of Black feminism\nthat drove it and kept the gallery afloat for more than\na decade, despite inequities of funding, recognition,\nand sponsorship.

But she also relied on\nthe support of a cohort of Black women (and numer-\nous men) whose intellectual prowess, activism, and\nfearlessness mirrored her own, and with whom she\nfelt kinship (fig. 4). Early on Gylbert Coker, Pat\nCummings, Lowery Stokes Sims, and Faythe Weaver,\namong others, helped renovate the space, sat at the\nfront desk, and shared their own funds.'? At JAM\ndowntown, artists including Lorraine O\u2019Grady and\nJanet Olivia Henry volunteered. Matching these\nwomen\u2019s very real day-to-day engagement was their\ninnovative and radical critical and art historical work,\nthrough which they made a place for JAM, and them-\nselves, in the world.\n\nIn 1972, in the wake of its missteps with the Harlem\non My Mind exhibition of 1969, the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art hired Sims in Education and Community\nPrograms; by 1974 she was the first\u2014and for decades\nwould be the only\u2014Black curator at what is arguably\nthis country\u2019s most visible museum. In an art world\nthat clung to the trappings of certain types of formal\nschematics, Sims insisted on a d\u00e9tente between\nfiguration and abstraction. Like Goode Bryant, she\nforegrounded artists whose \u201ccritical practices\u201d and, to\na certain degree, \u201covert subject matter\u201d upset \u201cassump-\ntions about forms, materials, conventions of represen-\ntation, or the institutional framework of art.\u201d Writing\nin Arts Magazine, Artforum, and High Performance,\nshe began to elucidate a broader investigative field for\nBlack artists, sketching the significance of Robert\n\n", "136": "Colescott and Wifredo Lam, and of live work by\nUrban Bush Women and Thought Music. She also\nwrote reviews of shows at JAM, including Noah\nJemison\u2019s solo presentation in 1977. Judith Wilson,\n\na Californian, was more directly a part of the art\njournalism apparatus. Wilson turned to art writing\n\nin the late 1970s, covering shows at JAM and the\nStudio Museum and the artists in those circles, such\nas Pindell, Hassinger, Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe,\n\nand Beverly Buchanan, in popular publications like\nMs, Essence, and the Village Voice. Faythe Weaver\u2014\nlike Goode Bryant a native of Columbus, Ohio, and a\nyoung mother and graduate student when they met\u2014\nreviewed JAM and Studio Museum exhibitions in\n\nthe Amsterdam News, New York\u2019s Black paper of record\nthroughout the twentieth century. However, it was\nCoker who first opened the door to more substantive\nwriting on art in that outlet when she approached\nsenior cultural writer Mel Tapley with the idea in the\nlate 1970s. Initially an artist and a member of Where\nWe At, a collective of Black women creators, Coker\nwrote articles for the Amsterdam News on a wide range\nof topics: solo shows of Betye Saar\u2019s work, historical\nAfrican and Haitian art, art collecting, and exhibitions\nat Cinque Gallery, Tim Blackburn Gallery, and JAM,\nwhere the work of Black artists could always be found.\nBy the 1980s Coker would increasingly appear in\n\nthe record as a curator. With Horace Brockington she\norganized the Art Across the Park series, which\nbrought temporary work by Hassinger, O\u2019Grady,\nBillops, Lydia Okumura, Ana Mendieta, and others to\npublic parks throughout New York City, inspired by\nJAM\u2019s philosophy, strategies, and artists.'\u00ae\n\nEvident in the writing by Sims, Wilson, Weaver,\nand Coker is a captivation with the participatory\npractices that became a signature of JAM. Coker\u2019s take\non JAM\u2019s 1978 summer show It\u2019s a Crowd describes\nthe feel of works tumbling into the viewer while they\nnavigate the gallery.!7 Her review of The Process as Art:\nIn Situ, which took place later the same year, examines\na project that shifted over weeks as it attempted to\nteveal the creative process, with the public welcome\nto watch.'* Here we find JAM and Goode Bryant\ncontinuing to explore the boundaries between per-\nformance and visual art, and intuitively shaping the\nlaboratory model that would energize the gallery\u2019s last\niteration, at 503 Broadway.\n\nIn this particular story of Black feminism, Goode\nBryant and this network of women\u2014in physically\nPulling the gallery together, keeping it going, and\ncreating an intellectual space for it to thrive\u2014pushed\nagainst the parochialisms of the art world itself.!\nMore broadly, they sought to demolish the calcified\ntraditions and worldviews that had existed for cen-\nturies, instantiated with colonialism and enslavement,\nand formalized as the inequities in life and cultural\nPossibility that followed. For this writer, the art world\n\n\u201cculture wars\u201d of the late twentieth century did not\ncommence in 1989 with the targeting of queer imag-\nery, or in 1993 with outcries against a more diverse\nbiennial at the Whitney Museum\u2014they were sewn into\nthe fabric of American life from the outset. However,\none earlier moment, in 1979, made vivid the contest of\npower and visibility. And Goode Bryant, Pindell, Sims,\n\u2018Wilson, and many others weighed in.\n\nIn Jeff Chang\u2019s thorough retelling of the Nigger\nDrawings controversy of 1979, it is Henry\u2019s visit to\nthe infamous show at Artists Space, in SoHo, that set\nprotest and refusal in motion, alerting the community\naround JAM to the artist Donald Newman\u2019s titling of\nhis exhibition of charcoal pictures with the expletive,\nas a way to indicate the works\u2019 lowly origin.\u201d Black\nartists and their supporters pushed back with a rapid\nletter-writing campaign to funding agencies, repudi-\nating white artists who were \u201csmug & secure\u201d in their\nmobilizations of a \u201cracial slur used under the guise of\naesthetic freedom\u201d! and \u201ctawdry sensationalist tactics\u201d?\nthat challenged a Black humanity.\n\nMonologic discourse was cracking under the\nweight of more encompassing global theory and the\npractices of artists and cultural workers worldwide\nthat took it up.\u201d Art was not a white neighborhood,\nand neither was New York\u2019s downtown. A year later\nLinda Goode Bryant would open JAM on Franklin\nStreet, a pioneer in Tribeca, bringing a capacious and\never-evolving \u201ctheoretical context for the work of\n\nblack artists.\u201d**\n\nIn memory of Just Above Midtown artist and stalwart\nSandra Payne.

In addition to JAM, a surprising\nnexus of institutions seems to\n\nhhave coalesced these women: the\n\u201cMetropolitan Museum of Art (where\n\u2018Sims and Goode Bryant both\n\nlanded in Education and Community\nPrograms in 1972), the Rockefeller\nFoundation (Goode Bryant and\nCoker were both fellows), and The\n\u2018Studio Museum in Harlem (where\nGoode Bryant, Coker, and Henry\nworked as educators, Pindell showed,\n\u2018and Sims curated during this period).\nGoode Bryant dedicated JAM\u2019s\ninaugural exhibition, Synthesisto\n\u2018Sims (among others).

Performers and playwrights as\ndiverse as Adrienne Kennedy, Lenora Champagne, and.\nDaryl Chin submitted work for consideration or were.\nfeatured in JAM\u2019s program. Among its peers, JAM was\na uniquely important space for performance by Black,\nBrown, and Indigenous women, who were often cre-\natively responding to exclusion and violence experi-\nenced across generations. Among them were Kaylynn,\nSullivan TwoTrees (then Sullivan) and the members of\nthe company Spiderwoman Theater, all of whom incor-\nporated memory and oral history into \u201ccounterprac-\ntices\u201d that addressed the daily challenges and stereo-\ntypical representations faced by women of color, while\nplaying with the capacity of performance to bridge the\ndivide between the world of the studio or gallery andlife,\nbeyond it.*\n\nTwoTrees joined the JAM community at Franklin\nStreet as a performance artist with a background in\ndance and theater; she also served as a consultant to\nthe gallery. Her debut work, Victims (1981), addressed,\ndomestic violence and was grounded in a childhood\nstory of murder in her family. Audience members were\npresented with a series of vignettes in the form of\nvideo footage, audio recordings, and a performance by\n\u2018TwoTrees and Tone Blevins, all while the smell of roast-\ning chicken filled the space.* The work concluded with\nthe audience eating the freshly cooked meal, which.\nreinforced the association that had been established\nbetween nourishment, consumption, and violence, and\nbrought the audience into the situation they had just\nwitnessed.\" As Robert Massa wrote in the Village Voice,\nthe work \u201cwas not only \u2018conceived\u2019 but \u2018actualized\u2019\nthrough TwoTrees's experimentation with the dual role\nof witness and participant.\u201d In Victims (plural), collec\ntive participation offered a creative means to disruptthe\n\u2018experience of the victim (singular).\n\nExperimentation with ensemble productions and\nnarratives about interpersonal history continued at 503\n\n15.

(The\nShared Resources program, which ran from 1985 to 1986,\noffered free space for rehearsals and performances, and\nmade JAM on Broadway the first venue to present the\nwork of several artists.)\n\n;cond night of the festival, Graham Haynes\nand No Image played work guided by the Brooklyn-based\n\u2018movement M-Base\u2019s philosophy of sound making, which\nutilized improvisation to create expressive music derived\n\ngroup formed by Haynes\n\u2018and Coleman in 1979 that turned ordinary funkon itshead\nby breaking from traditional song structure and using,\npop and jaz sounds.

In each\nposition, she has advocated \u201cour innate ability to use\nWat we have to create what we need\u201d and developed\nniving installations\u201d that feature collaborative activities\ncapable of changing the circumstances of those who\nporticipate in them.\n\n\u2018Goode Bryant was born in Columbus, Ohio, in1949,\nand earned a bachelor of arts degree in painting from\n\u2018Spelman College. She moved to New York City to pur-\nsuea master\u2019s degree in at history at City College in\n1972, and two years later opaned Just Above Midtown\nAN), a gallery centered on African American artists,\nand artists of color. At each of its three locations, in\nMidtown, Tribeca, and SoHo, it offered early\u2014and\noften unique\u2014opportunities to artists, providing\nspace and money for them to experiment freoy,\nunconstrained by art-market pressures. After closing\nJAM in 1986, Goode Bryant\u2014who hed received an\nMBA from Columbia University in 1980\u2014worked\na senior policy analyst for development in Mayor\nDavid Dinkins\u2019s administration. In the mid-1990s she\ndecided to dedicate herself to filmmaking. Her doo-\nFlag Wars (2003), codirected with Laura\n,, was shot over four years in Goode Bryant's\nhometown, An intimate portrait of a community\n<dealing with the tension between preservation and\nsentrifcation, it received numerous honors, includ-\ningan Emmy nomination and a Peabody.

Her workin film earned\nher a Guggenhoim Fellowship in 2004,\n\nIn 2004, Goode Bryant also established the Active\nCitizen Project (ACP) to involve disenfranchised and\nnon-voting youth and adults around the country\nin crafting and campaigning for local and national\nplatforms that addressed issues important to them.\nIn2009, ACP\u2019s work shifted from elections to Project\nEATS, a network of small-plot, high-yield farms and\nrolated programs located in low-income communities\n\u2018throughout New York, including Belmont and Mott\nHaven in the Bronx and Brownsville and Cypress Hill\nin Brooklyn. Goode Bryant continues to experiment\nwith methods of connecting culture, nature, and\n\nsustenance through new kinds of creative collective\nproduction. In 2024, she collaborated with archi-\ntect Elizabeth Diller on Are we really that diferent?,\nan installation that brought farming and video into\n\u2018conversation as part ofthe exhibition Social Works at\nNew York's Gagosian Gallery.

Upon\nnotice of the sale, JAM had to shift its attention from an active\nyear of regular exhibition and presenting programs, the imple-\nmentation of a major project on popular culture and a documentary\njam on the art meiket to an assessment of its organizational and\nprogram needs for the future. As a result, JAM made several\nmajor changes: organizationally it sought to sionificantly\nJSAIM increase its earned income and secure 2 long-term site for its\nactivities through the development of a large Soho spac\nProgrammatically, it introduced the \"Laboratory Program\" which\njam allowed JAM to provide artists with financial, administrative and\n\nCreative support in the development of new art and/or new art\nforms,\n\njam JAM was successful in these efforts. External conditions,\nhowever, adversely effected JAM's ability to remain in the spece\nand in August 1986 JAN moved. From then, JAF worked toward\njam strengthening and reorganizing itself so that it could\neffectively resume programs which continued to address the\ncurrent needs of artists and their public(s).\n\njem\nclear up the debris from the past and excited as hell about the\nprograms we've planned in the coming year. From new artists, new\n\njem works, and new environments to new formats? (yes, there is 2 By\nCulture). We're kicking it off with a 4 night, music/performance\nseries at the Knitting Factory, 47 East Houston Street between\n\narr Nott and Mulberry, At 9 & 11 PM you can listen to Geri Allen,\n\nj solo on June 2; Graham Haynes & Yo Image on June 3, Fred Holland\npug ponceliosre on June 4, and Lawrence (Butch) oe pens\non dune 5th, We're working on a vocal surprise on the :\n\njem\n\nYes, JAM's still here, proud about the progress we're making to |\n\nYes, we're out to get your enthusiastic, emphathetic and, of\ncourse, energetic support.
